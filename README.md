This repository is a comprehensive, structured, and detailed resource for students, language enthusiasts, and NLP engineers alike. It covers a wide range of linguistic concepts, structures, and studies, making it a perfect companion for both academic and practical learning. From the intricacies of phonetics to the nuances of computational linguistics, this repository serves as an extensive linguistic thesaurus.

## Why Use This Repository?

- Dive deep into the multiple **subfields** of linguistics, from the **foundational structures** of language to specialized studies.
- Follow an **organized** pathway that takes you through the basics to advanced topics in various areas of linguistics.
- Useful for both **theoretical** linguistics and **applied** fields such as NLP and language processing.

### **Important Note**:
Throughout this repository, you will find links to Wikipedia for additional reference. Enhance your study experience by using the [Wiki-Helper](https://github.com/z00logist/wiki-helper) widget, which allows you to interactively ask questions about Wikipedia articles for in-depth understanding.
