The scientific study of language, encompassing its structure, use, and historical development. Linguistics aims to uncover the principles that govern all human languages.

> "Linguistics can be defined as the systematic inquiry into human languageâ€”into its structures and uses and the relationship between them, as well as into its development through history and its acquisition by children and adults."
