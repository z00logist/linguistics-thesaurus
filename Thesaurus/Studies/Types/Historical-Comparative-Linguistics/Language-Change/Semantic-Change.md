# Semantic Change

Semantic change refers to the evolution of word meanings over time. Understanding these changes is crucial for historical linguistics and etymology.

## Types of Semantic Change

- **Narrowing (Specialization)**: A word's meaning becomes more specific.
  - *Example*: "Meat" once meant food in general; now it refers specifically to animal flesh.
- **Widening (Generalization)**: A word's meaning becomes more general.
  - *Example*: "Bird" once referred specifically to young birds; now it includes all birds.
- **Metaphor**: A word acquires a new meaning based on similarity.
  - *Example*: "Mouse" as a computer device.
- **Metonymy**: A word takes on a new meaning closely associated with the original.
  - *Example*: "Crown" representing monarchy.
- **Pejoration**: A word's meaning becomes more negative.
  - *Example*: "Silly" once meant happy or fortunate; now it means lacking good sense.
- **Amelioration**: A word's meaning becomes more positive.
  - *Example*: "Knight" originally meant servant; now it denotes a noble title.

## Mechanisms of Change

- **Cultural Shifts**: Changes in society and technology influence word meanings.
- **Language Contact**: Borrowing and calquing can alter meanings.
- **Polysemy and Homonymy**: Multiple meanings can lead to semantic drift.
- **Euphemism and Taboo**: Words may change to avoid offense.
