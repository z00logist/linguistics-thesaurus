# Semantic Change

Semantic change refers to the evolution of word meanings over time. Understanding these changes is crucial for historical linguistics and etymology.

## Types of Semantic Change

- **Narrowing (Specialization)**
  - *Example*: "Meat" once meant food in general; now it refers specifically to animal flesh.
- **Widening (Generalization)**
  - *Example*: "Bird" once referred specifically to young birds; now it includes all birds.
- **Metaphor**
  - *Example*: "Mouse" as a computer device.
- **Metonymy**
  - *Example*: "Crown" representing monarchy.
- **Pejoration**
  - *Example*: "Silly" once meant happy or fortunate; now it means lacking good sense.
- **Amelioration**
  - *Example*: "Knight" originally meant servant; now it denotes a noble title.
