# Sound Change

Sound change refers to systematic alterations in pronunciation that occur within a language over time. Understanding sound changes is crucial for reconstructing proto-languages and studying language evolution.

## Types of Sound Changes

- **Assimilation**: A sound becomes similar to a neighboring sound.
  - *Example*: Latin "octo" → Italian "otto" (the "c" assimilates to "t").
- **Dissimilation**: A sound becomes less like a neighboring sound.
  - *Example*: Latin "peregrinus" → Spanish "peregrino" (change to avoid repetition).
- **Metathesis**: Switching positions of sounds in a word.
  - *Example*: Old English "brid" → Modern English "bird".
- **Elision**: Loss of a sound.
  - *Example*: French "parler" → "parlé" (loss of the "r" sound).
- **Epenthesis**: Insertion of a sound.
  - *Example*: Old English "empty" → "emty" (addition of "p").

## Laws and Principles

- **Grimm's Law**: Describes consonant shifts in the Germanic languages.
- **Verner's Law**: Addresses exceptions to Grimm's Law based on stress patterns.
- **The Great Vowel Shift**: A major change in the pronunciation of English vowels during the 15th to 18th centuries.

## Methods

- **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing cognates across related languages.
- **Phonetic Transcription**: Recording sounds accurately for analysis.
- **Regularity Principle**: Assuming that sound changes are regular and systematic.
