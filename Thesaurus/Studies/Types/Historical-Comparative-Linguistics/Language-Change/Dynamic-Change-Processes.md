# Dynamic Change Processes

Dynamic change processes refer to the mechanisms and factors that drive language change over time, including phonetic, morphological, syntactic, and semantic changes.

## Key Processes

### Phonetic and Phonological Changes

- **Lenition and Fortition**: Weakening or strengthening of sounds.
- **Assimilation and Dissimilation**: Sounds becoming more similar or different.
- **Merger and Split**: Phonemes merging into one or splitting into separate phonemes.

### Morphological Changes

- **Analogical Change**: Regularization of irregular forms based on patterns.
- **Grammaticalization**: Content words evolving into grammatical markers.
- **Morphological Reanalysis**: Misinterpretation of morphological boundaries leading to new structures.

### Syntactic Changes

- **Word Order Shifts**: Changes in the typical arrangement of sentence elements.
- **Loss or Gain of Grammatical Categories**: Such as the development of articles or auxiliary verbs.
- **Reanalysis**: Assigning a new syntactic structure to existing forms.

### Semantic and Lexical Changes

- **Neologisms**: Creation of new words.
- **Loanwords**: Adoption of words from other languages.
- **Semantic Shifts**: Changes in word meanings.

## Factors Influencing Change

- **Social Factors**: Prestige, identity, and social networks.
- **Language Contact**: Influence from other languages or dialects.
- **Cognitive Factors**: Ease of processing, perception, and production.
- **Technological and Cultural Developments**: New concepts requiring new vocabulary.

## Theories and Models

- **Labov's Principles of Linguistic Change**: Social motivations for change.
- **Grammaticalization Theory**: Processes by which words become grammatical markers.
- **Usage-Based Models**: Emphasize the role of frequency and patterns in language change.
