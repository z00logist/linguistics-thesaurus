# Language Contact

Language contact occurs when speakers of different languages or dialects interact regularly, leading to linguistic influence and changes.

## Types of Contact-Induced Change

- **Borrowing**: Adoption of words, phrases, or structures from one language into another.
- **Code-Switching**: Alternating between languages within a conversation or utterance.
- **Pidgins and Creoles**: New languages that develop from prolonged contact between groups without a common language.
- **Language Shift**: When a community gradually abandons its native language in favor of another.

## Factors Influencing Language Contact

- **Social Dynamics**: Power relations, prestige, and attitudes toward languages.
- **Proximity**: Geographic closeness facilitating interaction.
- **Trade and Migration**: Economic and population movements promoting contact.

## Effects

- **Lexical Borrowing**: Incorporation of foreign vocabulary.
- **Structural Borrowing**: Adoption of phonological, morphological, or syntactic features.
- **Language Convergence**: Languages becoming more similar due to prolonged contact.
