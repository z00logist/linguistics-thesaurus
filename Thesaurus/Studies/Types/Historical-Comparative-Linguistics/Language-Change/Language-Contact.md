# Language Contact

Language contact occurs when speakers of different languages or dialects interact frequently, leading to mutual influence and linguistic change.

## Types of Contact-Induced Change

- Borrowing involves adopting words, phrases, or even structural elements from one language into another.
- Code-switching happens when speakers alternate between languages within a conversation.
- Pidgins and creoles are new languages that form when groups without a shared language develop a simplified means of communication, which may evolve into a fully developed creole.
- Language shift occurs when a community gradually moves from using its native language to adopting another.

## Factors Influencing Language Contact

- Social dynamics, including power relations and the prestige associated with certain languages, influence how languages interact.
- Geographic proximity can make it easier for communities to interact and exchange linguistic features.
- Trade and migration facilitate contact as economic exchanges and population movements bring speakers of different languages together.

## Effects

- Lexical borrowing introduces foreign vocabulary into a language.
- Structural borrowing affects phonology, morphology, or syntax, incorporating elements from another language.
- Language convergence results in languages becoming more alike over time due to sustained contact.
