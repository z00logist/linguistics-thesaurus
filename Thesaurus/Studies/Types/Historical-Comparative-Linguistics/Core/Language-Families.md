# Language Families

Language families are groups of languages that have evolved from a common ancestral language, known as a proto-language. Understanding language families helps linguists trace linguistic evolution and relationships.

## Major Language Families

- **Indo-European**: Includes languages like English, Spanish, Hindi, and Russian.
- **Sino-Tibetan**: Encompasses Mandarin Chinese, Burmese, and Tibetan.
- **Afro-Asiatic**: Contains Arabic, Hebrew, and Amharic.
- **Niger-Congo**: Includes Swahili, Yoruba, and Zulu.
- **Austronesian**: Covers languages like Malay, Tagalog, and Maori.

## Classification Criteria

- **Genetic Relationships**: Shared ancestry inferred from systematic similarities.
- **Cognates**: Words in different languages that have a common origin.
- **Sound Correspondences**: Regular phonetic similarities across languages.



## Methods

- **Comparative Method**: Comparing languages to establish genetic relationships.
- **Lexicostatistics**: Measuring linguistic divergence based on core vocabulary.
- **Phylogenetic Analysis**: Using computational models to infer language trees.
