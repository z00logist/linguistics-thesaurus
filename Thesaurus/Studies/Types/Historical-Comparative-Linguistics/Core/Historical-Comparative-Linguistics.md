# Historical-Comparative Linguistics

Historical-Comparative Linguistics examines how languages change over time and the relationships among languages. It seeks to reconstruct ancestral languages and understand the processes that drive linguistic evolution.

## Key Objectives

- **Language Reconstruction**: Rebuilding aspects of unattested ancestral languages.
- **Classification**: Grouping languages into families based on common ancestry.
- **Understanding Language Change**: Studying phonological, morphological, syntactic, and semantic changes.
- **Language Contact**: Investigating how languages influence each other through contact.

## Essentials

- **Sound Change**: Systematic phonetic changes in a language over time.
- **Comparative Method**: Technique for reconstructing proto-languages by comparing cognates.
- **Internal Reconstruction**: Using irregularities within a single language to hypothesize about earlier forms.
- **Language Families**: Groups of languages descended from a common ancestor.
