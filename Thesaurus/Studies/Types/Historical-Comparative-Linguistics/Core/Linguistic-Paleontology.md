# Linguistic Paleontology

Linguistic paleontology is a method that uses reconstructed words from proto-languages to infer details about the culture, environment, and homeland of ancient peoples.

## Essentials
Cultural reconstruction uses linguistic evidence to deduce aspects of material culture, social structures, and belief systems. Ecological inferences help identify the plants, animals, and geographical features known to the speakers of a proto-language. These linguistic insights are often correlated with archaeological findings to form a more complete historical picture.

## Methodology

1. Reconstruct vocabulary that relates to cultural or environmental concepts.
2. Analyze semantic fields, which are groups of related words, to understand broader topics.
3. Use this information to make educated guesses about the culture and environment of proto-language speakers.
