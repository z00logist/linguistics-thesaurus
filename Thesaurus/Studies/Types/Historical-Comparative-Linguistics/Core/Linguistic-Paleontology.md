# Linguistic Paleontology

Linguistic paleontology is a method that uses reconstructed vocabulary from proto-languages to make inferences about the culture, environment, and homeland of ancient peoples.

## Key Concepts

- **Cultural Reconstruction**: Inferring aspects of material culture, social structure, and beliefs.
- **Ecological Inferences**: Understanding the flora, fauna, and geography known to proto-language speakers.
- **Archaeological Correlation**: Aligning linguistic findings with archaeological evidence.

## Methodology

1. **Reconstruct Vocabulary**: Identify words related to specific cultural or environmental concepts.
2. **Analyze Semantic Fields**: Group related words to understand broader concepts.
3. **Draw Inferences**: Make educated guesses about the proto-culture.
