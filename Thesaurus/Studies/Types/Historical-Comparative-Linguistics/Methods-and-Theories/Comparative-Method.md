# Comparative Method

The Comparative Method is a systematic approach in historical linguistics used to reconstruct proto-languages by analyzing and comparing features of related languages.

## Steps in the Comparative Method

1. Assemble cognate lists by collecting words that have similar forms and meanings across related languages.
2. Identify sound correspondences by observing regular patterns of phonetic changes.
3. Reconstruct proto-forms to infer the ancestral versions of words.
4. Formulate sound laws to describe the systematic changes that have occurred.
5. Check for regularity to ensure that the proposed sound changes apply consistently across the data.

## Principles

- The regularity of sound change suggests that changes in pronunciation are systematic and can be predicted.
- Directionality indicates that certain types of phonetic changes are more common or likely than others.
- Occam's Razor is applied, favoring the simplest explanation that fits the data.
