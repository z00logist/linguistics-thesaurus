# Comparative Method

The Comparative Method is a systematic approach used in historical linguistics to reconstruct proto-languages by comparing features of related languages.

## Steps in the Comparative Method

1. **Assemble Cognate Lists**: Collect words with similar forms and meanings across languages.
2. **Establish Sound Correspondences**: Identify regular patterns of sound changes.
3. **Reconstruct Proto-Forms**: Infer the ancestral forms of words.
4. **Formulate Sound Laws**: Describe the phonetic changes that have occurred.
5. **Check for Regularity**: Ensure that sound changes apply consistently.

## Principles

- **Regularity of Sound Change**: Sound changes are systematic and predictable.
- **Directionality**: Certain types of changes are more likely than others.
- **Occam's Razor**: Prefer the simplest explanation that accounts for the data.
