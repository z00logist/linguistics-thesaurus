# Language Classification

Language classification involves grouping languages based on shared characteristics, which can be genetic (historical), typological (structural), or areal (geographic).

## Types of Classification

### Genetic Classification

Grouping languages by common ancestry:

- Identifies relationships using the comparative method.
- Results in the formation of language families and subfamilies (e.g., Indo-European > Germanic > English).

### Typological Classification

Classifying languages by structural features:

- Phonological features focus on sound systems.
- Morphological traits include word formation processes, such as agglutinative or fusional structures.
- Syntactic patterns consider sentence structure types (e.g., SVO, SOV).

### Areal Classification

Grouping languages by geographic proximity:

- Focuses on how languages in close contact share features.
- Involves the concept of a *Sprachbund*, where languages influence each other.
