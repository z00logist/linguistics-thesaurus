# Language Classification

Language classification involves grouping languages based on shared features, which can be genetic (historical), typological (structural), or areal (geographic).

## Types of Classification

### Genetic Classification

- **Definition**: Grouping languages into families based on common ancestry.
- **Method**: Using the comparative method to identify genetic relationships.
- **Result**: Language families and subfamilies (e.g., Indo-European > Germanic > English).

### Typological Classification

- **Definition**: Classifying languages based on structural features.
- **Criteria**:
  - **Phonological**: Sound systems.
  - **Morphological**: Word formation processes (e.g., agglutinative, fusional).
  - **Syntactic**: Sentence structure (e.g., SVO, SOV).

### Areal Classification

- **Definition**: Grouping languages based on geographic proximity and shared features due to contact.
- **Concept**: **Sprachbund** (linguistic area) where languages influence each other.
