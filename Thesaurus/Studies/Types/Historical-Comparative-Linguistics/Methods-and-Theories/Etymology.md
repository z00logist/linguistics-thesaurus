# Etymology

Etymology is the study of the origins and historical development of words. This field explores how words have changed in form and meaning over time.

## Essentials

Etymology focuses on understanding word origins by identifying the earliest known use and source of a word. Borrowing refers to words adopted from other languages, while compound words are formed by combining existing ones. Derivation involves creating new words using prefixes or suffixes. Semantic change traces how meanings evolve over time.

## Methods

Etymologists use several methods to trace word histories:

- Historical documentation involves analyzing written records to track how words were used over time.
- Comparative linguistics looks at cognates in different languages to find common roots.
- Phonological analysis helps understand sound changes that link words historically.
- Morphological analysis studies the processes involved in word formation.
