# Glottochronology

Glottochronology is a method in historical linguistics that estimates when languages diverged by analyzing shared core vocabulary.

## Essentials

The foundation of glottochronology is lexicostatistics, which quantitatively compares lexical items across languages. It focuses on basic vocabulary—words like pronouns, numbers, and kinship terms—considered less prone to borrowing or replacement. Swadesh lists, which are standardized sets of basic vocabulary, are often used in these analyses.

## Methodology

1. Select basic vocabulary using Swadesh lists (typically 100 or 200 words).
2. Identify cognates, which are words that have a common origin across the languages.
3. Calculate the percentage of shared cognates between the languages.
4. Apply a mathematical decay formula to estimate the time of divergence.

### Decay Formula

\[ t = \frac{\log(c)}{2 \times \log(r)} \]

- **t** represents the estimated time since the languages diverged.
- **c** is the proportion of shared cognates.
- **r** is the retention rate, the assumed constant rate of vocabulary replacement.

## Assumptions

Glottochronology is based on key assumptions:

- A constant replacement rate, suggesting vocabulary changes at a steady rate over time.
- Basic vocabulary is universal and can be compared across languages.
- Minimal borrowing, assuming that the core vocabulary is not significantly influenced by borrowing.

## Criticisms

The method has its limitations:

- Change rates can vary widely between languages and cultures.
- Even basic vocabulary can sometimes be borrowed, impacting the accuracy.
- The statistical models and assumptions behind glottochronology have been questioned for their reliability.
