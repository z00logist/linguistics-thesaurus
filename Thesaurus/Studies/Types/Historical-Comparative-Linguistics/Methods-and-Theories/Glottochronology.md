# Glottochronology

Glottochronology is a method in historical linguistics that estimates the time of divergence between languages by analyzing the percentage of shared core vocabulary.

## Key Concepts

- **Lexicostatistics**: The quantitative comparison of lexical items across languages.
- **Basic Vocabulary**: Words less likely to be borrowed or replaced, such as pronouns, numbers, and kinship terms.
- **Swadesh Lists**: Standardized lists of basic vocabulary used in glottochronological studies.

## Methodology

1. **Select Basic Vocabulary**: Use Swadesh lists (100 or 200 words).
2. **Identify Cognates**: Determine which words are cognate across languages.
3. **Calculate Percentage of Cognates**: Find the proportion of shared cognates.
4. **Apply Decay Formula**: Use a mathematical formula to estimate divergence time.

### Decay Formula

\[ t = \frac{\log(c)}{2 \times \log(r)} \]

- **t**: Time since divergence.
- **c**: Proportion of shared cognates.
- **r**: Retention rate (assumed constant rate of vocabulary replacement).

## Assumptions

- **Constant Replacement Rate**: Assumes a consistent rate of lexical change over time.
- **Universal Vocabulary**: Presumes that basic vocabulary is comparable across languages.
- **Minimal Borrowing**: Assumes negligible borrowing of basic vocabulary.

## Criticisms

- **Variable Rates**: Rates of change can vary significantly between languages and cultures.
- **Borrowing**: Even basic vocabulary can be borrowed, affecting calculations.
- **Statistical Validity**: Questions about the reliability of the mathematical models used.
