# Internal Reconstruction

Internal Reconstruction is a linguistic method used to hypothesize about a languageâ€™s earlier forms by analyzing evidence from the language itself, without relying on comparisons with related languages.

## Key Concepts

The method looks at irregularities, such as anomalies in word forms, to infer historical stages. Morphophonemic alternations, where words show variations in form, can indicate past changes. Analogy is another focus, highlighting how irregular forms become regular over time.

## Steps in Internal Reconstruction

1. Identify alternations where forms vary in related contexts.
2. Hypothesize original forms that could explain these variations.
3. Formulate rules describing the changes that may have occurred.
4. Validate findings to ensure consistency and plausibility within the language.
