# Morphological Reconstruction

Morphological reconstruction aims to reconstruct the grammatical structures and morphological features of a proto-language by analyzing patterns observed in its descendant languages.

## Essentials

Morphological reconstruction focuses on identifying and understanding morphemes, which are the smallest units of meaning or grammatical function. It also involves studying affixation patterns such as prefixes, suffixes, and infixes, as well as reconstructing grammatical categories like tense, aspect, mood, case, and number.

## Methodology

The process involves several steps:

1. Identify cognate morphemes that have similar forms and functions across related languages.
2. Analyze the morphological structures by comparing how words are formed and inflected.
3. Reconstruct proto-morphemes by inferring their ancestral forms and meanings.
4. Establish morphological rules that describe the historical changes that occurred.
5. Validate the findings with phonological data to ensure consistency with sound reconstructions.
