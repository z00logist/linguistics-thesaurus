# Morphological Reconstruction

Morphological reconstruction involves reconstructing the morphological structures and grammatical features of a proto-language by analyzing patterns in descendant languages.

## Key Concepts

- **Morphemes**: The smallest units of meaning or grammatical function.
- **Affixation Patterns**: Suffixes, prefixes, infixes, and their historical development.
- **Grammatical Categories**: Tense, aspect, mood, case, number, etc.

## Methodology

1. **Identify Cognate Morphemes**: Find morphemes with similar form and function across languages.
2. **Analyze Morphological Structures**: Compare word formation and inflectional patterns.
3. **Reconstruct Proto-Morphemes**: Infer the ancestral forms and meanings.
4. **Establish Morphological Rules**: Describe historical changes in morphology.
5. **Validate with Phonological Data**: Ensure consistency with phonological reconstructions.

## Challenges

- **Analogical Changes**: Regularization can obscure original forms.
- **Morphological Erosion**: Loss of morphological markers over time.
- **Polysemy and Homonymy**: Multiple meanings complicate reconstructions.
