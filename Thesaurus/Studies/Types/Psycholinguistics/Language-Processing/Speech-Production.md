# Speech Production

Speech production is the process by which thoughts are translated into speech, involving the selection of words, the formation of grammatical structures, and the articulation of sounds.

## Stages of Speech Production

1. **Conceptualization**: Forming the intention to communicate.
2. **Formulation**:
   - **Lexical Selection**: Choosing appropriate words.
   - **Grammatical Encoding**: Structuring sentences.
   - **Phonological Encoding**: Preparing sounds for articulation.
3. **Articulation**: Physical production of speech sounds.
4. **Self-Monitoring**: Checking for errors and correcting them.

## Models

- **Levelt's Model**: A modular model outlining the stages above.
- **Dell's Spreading Activation Model**: Emphasizes interactive processes and error patterns.
- **Connectionist Models**: Use neural networks to simulate speech production.

## Speech Errors

- **Slips of the Tongue**: Errors in speech that reveal underlying processes.
  - **Anticipation**: "Bake my bike" instead of "Take my bike."
  - **Exchange**: "I must let the house out of the cat."
- **Tip-of-the-Tongue States**: Temporary inability to retrieve a word.
