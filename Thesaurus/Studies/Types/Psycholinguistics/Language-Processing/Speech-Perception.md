# Speech Perception

Speech perception is the process by which the brain processes spoken language, transforming acoustic signals into meaningful units.

## Key Processes

- **Acoustic Analysis**: Detecting sounds and frequencies.
- **Phonetic Processing**: Identifying phonemes (smallest units of sound).
- **Phonological Processing**: Understanding sound patterns and rules.
- **Lexical Access**: Matching sounds to known words.


## Theories

- **Motor Theory**: Perception linked to the motor processes of speech production.
- **Auditory Theories**: Perception based on auditory signal processing.
- **Cohort Model**: Word recognition starts with the initial sounds and narrows down.
- **Trace Model**: Interactive activation network that processes speech at multiple levels.
