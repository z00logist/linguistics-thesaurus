# Lexical Access

Lexical access refers to the process of retrieving a word's meaning, pronunciation, and syntactic properties from the mental lexicon during language comprehension and production.

## Mental Lexicon

- **Definition**: The mental dictionary containing knowledge about words.
- **Structure**: Organized based on semantics, phonology, morphology, and syntax.
- **Activation**: Words are activated based on context and frequency.

## Models of Lexical Access

- **Logogen Model**: Each word has a threshold for activation.
- **Search Models**: Lexicon is searched serially or in parallel.
- **Interactive Activation Model**: Words compete and inhibit each other.

## Factors Influencing Lexical Access

- **Word Frequency**: High-frequency words are accessed faster.
- **Context Effects**: Semantic context can facilitate access.
- **Phonological Similarity**: Words that sound alike can interfere.
