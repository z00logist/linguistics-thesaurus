# Sentence Processing

Sentence processing looks at the cognitive processes that help humans comprehend and produce sentences, involving real-time parsing of syntactic structures and interpreting meanings as sentences are heard or read.

## Parsing Strategies

Different strategies are used to parse and understand sentences:

- **Incremental Parsing** means sentences are processed word by word as they unfold.
- **Garden Path Sentences** can lead to initial misinterpretations, such as "The old man the boats," which momentarily misguides comprehension.
- **Parsing Models** explain how we handle sentence structures:
  - **Serial Models** process one syntactic interpretation at a time.
  - **Parallel Models** consider multiple interpretations at once.
  - **Constraint-Based Models** use various information sources, such as syntax, semantics, and context, to guide parsing.
