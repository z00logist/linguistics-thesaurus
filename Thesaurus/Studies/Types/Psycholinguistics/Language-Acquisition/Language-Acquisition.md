# Language Acquisition

Language acquisition studies how humans acquire the capacity to perceive, produce, and use language to communicate. It encompasses first language acquisition in children and second language acquisition in adults.

## First Language Acquisition

### Stages

1. **Babbling Stage**: Infants produce sounds (6-8 months).
2. **One-Word Stage**: Single words represent whole ideas (9-18 months).
3. **Two-Word Stage**: Simple combinations of words (18-24 months).
4. **Telegraphic Speech**: Short, simple sentences (24-30 months).
5. **Complex Sentences**: Use of grammar and complex structures (30+ months).

### Theories

- **Behaviorist Theory**: Language learned through imitation and reinforcement (Skinner).
- **Nativist Theory**: Innate language faculty (Chomsky's Universal Grammar).
- **Social Interactionist Theory**: Language develops through social interaction (Vygotsky).

## Second Language Acquisition

### Factors Influencing SLA

- **Age**: Critical Period Hypothesis suggests earlier learning leads to better proficiency.
- **Motivation**: Integrative and instrumental motivation impact learning.
- **Input and Interaction**: Exposure to language and opportunities to use it.

### Theories

- **Input Hypothesis**: Comprehensible input is necessary (Krashen).
- **Output Hypothesis**: Producing language aids acquisition (Swain).
- **Sociocultural Theory**: Emphasizes social context and interaction.
