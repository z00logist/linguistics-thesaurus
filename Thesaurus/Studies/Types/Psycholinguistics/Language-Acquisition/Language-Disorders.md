## Types of Language Disorders

### Aphasia

Aphasia is a condition where language abilities are lost or impaired due to brain damage. Different types of aphasia include:

- **Broca's Aphasia** involves difficulty with speech production while comprehension often remains intact.
- **Wernicke's Aphasia** results in fluent but nonsensical speech and impaired comprehension.
- **Global Aphasia** is a severe form affecting both language production and comprehension.

### Specific Language Impairment (SLI)

SLI refers to delayed or disordered language development without an apparent cause. People with SLI often struggle with grammar, vocabulary, and coherent discourse.

### Dyslexia

Dyslexia is a learning disorder that primarily affects reading and spelling. It is often associated with difficulties in phonological processing and word decoding.

### Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

Individuals with ASD may experience language issues, including challenges with pragmatics, understanding non-literal language, and social communication.
