# Bilingualism

Bilingualism refers to the ability to use two or more languages proficiently. Psycholinguistic research investigates how bilingual individuals process, acquire, and manage multiple languages.

## Types of Bilingualism

- **Simultaneous Bilingualism**: Learning two languages from birth.
- **Sequential Bilingualism**: Learning a second language after the first is established.
- **Balanced vs. Dominant Bilingualism**: Equal proficiency vs. stronger in one language.

## Cognitive Effects

- **Executive Control**: Enhanced ability to switch tasks and inhibit distractions.
- **Metalinguistic Awareness**: Better understanding of language as a system.
- **Cognitive Reserve**: Potential delay in the onset of dementia symptoms.

## Language Processing

- **Code-Switching**: Alternating between languages within a conversation.
- **Language Selection**: Managing interference between languages.
- **Lexical Access**: Shared or separate lexicons for different languages.
