# Bilingualism

Bilingualism is the ability to use two or more languages fluently. Psycholinguistic research explores how bilingual individuals learn, process, and manage their multiple languages.

## Types of Bilingualism

Bilingualism can be categorized in different ways:

- **Simultaneous Bilingualism** involves learning two languages from birth.
- **Sequential Bilingualism** happens when a second language is learned after the first one is already established.
- **Balanced Bilingualism** refers to having roughly equal proficiency in both languages, while **Dominant Bilingualism** means being stronger in one language than the other.

## Cognitive Effects

Being bilingual has various cognitive benefits:

- **Executive Control** is improved, making it easier to switch between tasks and ignore distractions.
- **Metalinguistic Awareness** is heightened, allowing bilinguals to better understand language as a system.
- **Cognitive Reserve** may be increased, potentially delaying the onset of dementia symptoms.

## Language Processing

Bilinguals face unique challenges and strategies in language processing:

- **Code-Switching** involves switching between languages during a conversation.
- **Language Selection** helps manage interference between languages.
- **Lexical Access** can vary, with bilinguals having either shared or separate word stores for their languages.
