# Psycholinguistics

Psycholinguistics explores the psychological and neurobiological factors that enable humans to acquire, use, comprehend, and produce language. It seeks to understand how language is represented and processed in the mind and brain.

## Key Areas

- **Language Acquisition**: How children and adults learn language.
- **Speech Perception**: How we perceive and interpret spoken language.
- **Speech Production**: How we produce spoken language.
- **Lexical Access**: How we retrieve words from memory.
- **Sentence Processing**: How we comprehend and produce sentences.
- **Bilingualism**: How knowing multiple languages affects cognition.
- **Language Disorders**: How language is affected by psychological or neurological impairments.

## Methods

- **Experimental Studies**: Reaction time experiments, priming tasks.
- **Neuroimaging**: fMRI, EEG, MEG to study brain activity.
- **Computational Modeling**: Simulating language processes using algorithms.
- **Observational Studies**: Naturalistic observation of language use.
