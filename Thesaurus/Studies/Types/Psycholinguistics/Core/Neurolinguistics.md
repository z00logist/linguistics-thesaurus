# Neurolinguistics

Neurolinguistics is the study of how language is represented and processed in the brain. It combines linguistics, neuroscience, and psychology to understand the neural mechanisms underlying language functions.

## Key Areas

- **Brain Regions**: Identifying areas involved in language (e.g., Broca's area, Wernicke's area).
- **Language Disorders**: Studying aphasia and other impairments to understand brain-language relationships.
- **Neuroimaging Techniques**:
  - **fMRI**: Measures brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood flow.
  - **EEG/ERP**: Records electrical activity to study timing of language processes.
  - **MEG**: Measures magnetic fields produced by neural activity.

## Topics

- **Language Lateralization**: Dominance of language functions in one hemisphere (typically the left).
- **Neural Plasticity**: Brain's ability to reorganize after injury, especially in language recovery.
- **Bilingual Brain**: How multiple languages are represented neurologically.
