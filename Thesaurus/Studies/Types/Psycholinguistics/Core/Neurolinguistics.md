# Neurolinguistics

Neurolinguistics explores how language is represented and processed in the brain. This interdisciplinary field combines knowledge from linguistics, neuroscience, and psychology to uncover the neural mechanisms that support language functions.

## Key Areas

Neurolinguistics focuses on several main areas. It studies brain regions involved in language, such as Broca's area, which is linked to speech production, and Wernicke's area, which is important for understanding language. Research into language disorders, like aphasia, provides insights into how different brain regions contribute to language and how communication is affected by impairments. Various neuroimaging techniques are used, including fMRI to track brain activity through blood flow, EEG/ERP to measure electrical activity and timing of language processes, and MEG to detect magnetic fields produced by neural activity.

## Topics

The field includes various topics that show how the brain manages language. Language lateralization examines how language functions are usually more dominant in one hemisphere, often the left. Neural plasticity looks at the brain's ability to reorganize itself after injury, particularly in the recovery of language functions. Studies on the bilingual brain explore how multiple languages are represented and processed neurologically.
