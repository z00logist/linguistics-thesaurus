# Cognitive Linguistics

Cognitive linguistics is a modern linguistic theory that emerged in the late 20th century. It suggests that language mirrors patterns of thought and that understanding language is intertwined with general cognitive functions.

## Essentials

Cognitive linguistics is built on several key principles. It emphasizes that language is deeply connected to our bodily experiences and interactions with the world, known as embodiment. Meaning is seen as arising from mental representations and cognitive processes, reflecting how people conceptualize their experiences. The usage-based model proposes that linguistic knowledge develops through actual language use. Cognitive linguistics also rejects the idea of language as a separate, modular faculty, suggesting instead that it is integrated with other cognitive processes.

## Main Branches

Cognitive linguistics encompasses different branches, each focusing on specific aspects of language and cognition:

- Cognitive semantics examines how experience and embodied cognition relate to language.
- Cognitive approaches to grammar see grammar as a manifestation of conceptual processes.
- Cognitive pragmatics looks at how shared knowledge and context influence how language is used.
