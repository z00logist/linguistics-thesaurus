# Cognitive Linguistics

Cognitive linguistics is a modern school of linguistic thought that emerged in the late 20th century. It argues that language reflects patterns of thought and that linguistic knowledge is part of general cognition.


## Key Principles

- **Embodiment**: Language is grounded in our bodily experiences and interactions with the world.
- **Conceptualization**: Meaning arises from mental representations and cognitive processes.
- **Usage-Based Model**: Linguistic knowledge emerges from language use.
- **Non-Modularity**: Rejects the idea that language is a separate module; instead, it's integrated with other cognitive faculties.

## Main Branches

- **Cognitive Semantics**: Focuses on the relationship between experience, embodied cognition, and language.
- **Cognitive Approaches to Grammar**: Views grammar as a reflection of conceptualization processes.
- **Cognitive Pragmatics**: Studies how context and shared knowledge influence language use.
