# Construction Grammar

Construction Grammar refers to a group of linguistic theories that suggest language is made up of constructions, which are learned pairings of form and meaning. These constructions can range from simple morphemes to complex syntactic structures.

## Essentials

Construction Grammar is built on a few main principles. Constructions are form-meaning pairings that exist at every level of language. There is no strict separation between the lexicon and syntax, as both are seen as constructions. This approach is usage-based, meaning that language knowledge develops through language use and exposure.

## Types of Constructions

Constructions come in various forms, such as:

- Morpheme-level constructions, like "-ed," which indicates past tense.
- Word-level constructions, where individual words carry specific meanings.
- Phrase-level constructions, including idiomatic expressions like "kick the bucket."
- Sentence-level constructions, which cover broader grammatical patterns, such as the ditransitive structure used in sentences like "She gave him a book."
