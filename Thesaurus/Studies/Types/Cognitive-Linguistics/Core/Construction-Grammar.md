# Construction Grammar

Construction Grammar is a family of theories that posit that language consists of constructions, or learned pairings of form and meaning, ranging from morphemes to complex syntactic structures.

## Key Principles

- **Constructions**: Form-meaning pairings at all levels of language.
- **No Strict Separation**: Between lexicon and syntax; all are constructions.
- **Usage-Based**: Language knowledge emerges from language use.

## Types of Constructions

- **Morpheme-Level**: Smallest units of meaning (e.g., "-ed" for past tense).
- **Word-Level**: Individual words as constructions.
- **Phrase-Level**: Idioms and fixed expressions (e.g., "kick the bucket").
- **Sentence-Level**: Grammatical patterns (e.g., the ditransitive construction).

## Applications

- **Language Acquisition**: Understanding how constructions are learned.
- **Syntax Analysis**: Analyzing sentence structures based on constructions.
- **Cross-Linguistic Studies**: Comparing constructions across languages.

## Related Theories

- **Cognitive Grammar**: Focuses on the symbolic nature of grammar.
- **Embodied Construction Grammar**: Integrates embodied cognition with construction grammar.
