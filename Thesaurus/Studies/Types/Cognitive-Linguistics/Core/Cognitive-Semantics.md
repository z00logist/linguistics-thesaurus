# Cognitive Semantics

Cognitive semantics is a subfield within cognitive linguistics that explores how language and the mind are connected, focusing on the ways linguistic meaning is formed and understood.

## Essentials

Cognitive semantics emphasizes several core ideas. Meaning is constructed through mental representations, with our conceptual systems deeply influenced by embodied experiences. Words are linked within a network of meanings, creating interconnected semantic webs. Polysemy is also common, where a single word has multiple, related meanings.

## Theoretical Foundations

Theoretical concepts in cognitive semantics include image schemas, which are recurring patterns from sensory and motor experiences that shape how we think. Frames represent stereotypical situations that structure our understanding of events. Prototypes are central examples within categories that help define how we view a group of items.

## Examples

Examples in cognitive semantics illustrate how we use language to reflect our experiences. Spatial prepositions like "in," "on," and "over" are understood through their underlying spatial relationships. Metaphorical mappings, such as "time is money," show how abstract ideas are conceptualized using more concrete experiences.
