# Cognitive Semantics

Cognitive semantics is a subfield within cognitive linguistics that explores how language and the mind are connected, focusing on the ways linguistic meaning is formed and understood.

## Essentials
Meaning is constructed through mental representations, with our conceptual systems deeply influenced by embodied experiences. Words are linked within a network of meanings, creating interconnected semantic webs. Polysemy is also common, where a single word has multiple, related meanings.

## Examples
Spatial prepositions like "in," "on," and "over" are understood through their underlying spatial relationships. Metaphorical mappings, such as "time is money," show how abstract ideas are conceptualized using more concrete experiences.
