# Cognitive Approaches to Grammar

Cognitive approaches to grammar view grammatical structures as inherently meaningful and arising from cognitive processes rather than arbitrary rules.

## Key Principles

- **Meaningful Grammar**: Grammar expresses semantic and conceptual content.
- **Emergent Structures**: Grammatical patterns emerge from language use.
- **Integration with Cognition**: Grammar is intertwined with perception, attention, and memory.

## Theories

- **Cognitive Grammar**: Developed by Langacker, focuses on symbolic and conceptual nature of grammar.
- **Construction Grammar**: Emphasizes that all grammatical structures are constructions with form and meaning.
- **Embodied Grammar**: Explores how bodily experiences influence grammatical structures.

age patterns influence grammatical evolution.
