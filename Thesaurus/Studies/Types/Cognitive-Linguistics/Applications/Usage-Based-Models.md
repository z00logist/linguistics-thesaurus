# Usage-Based Models

Usage-based models in cognitive linguistics propose that linguistic knowledge emerges from language use. They emphasize the role of frequency and patterns in shaping language structure.

## Key Principles

- **Frequency Effects**: High-frequency constructions are learned and processed more easily.
- **Schema Formation**: Generalizations are made from specific instances.
- **Emergence**: Grammar and linguistic patterns emerge from usage.

## Evidence

- **Zipf's Law**: Predicts the frequency distribution of words.
- **Lexical Access**: Frequent words are recognized faster.
- **Construction Learning**: Patterns become entrenched with repeated use.
