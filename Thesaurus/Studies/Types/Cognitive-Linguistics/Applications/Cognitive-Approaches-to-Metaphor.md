# Cognitive Approaches to Metaphor

Cognitive approaches to metaphor examine how metaphors are fundamental to thought and not just linguistic expressions, influencing how we perceive and interact with the world.

## Key Concepts

- **Conceptual Metaphor**: Understanding one domain in terms of another.
- **Metaphorical Mapping**: Systematic correspondences between source and target domains.
- **Embodied Metaphor**: Grounding metaphors in physical experiences.



## Examples

- **Argument is War**: "He attacked my argument."
- **Life is a Journey**: "She's at a crossroads in her life."
