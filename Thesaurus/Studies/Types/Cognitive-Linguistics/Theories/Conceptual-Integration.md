# Conceptual Integration (Blending Theory)

Conceptual Integration, or Blending Theory, is a cognitive process where elements from different scenarios merge into a single mental space, creating new meanings and insights.

## Key Components

Understanding blending involves several main ideas:

- **Mental Spaces** are the partial representations of situations we construct as we think and communicate.
- **Input Spaces** bring elements from different mental spaces to contribute to the blend.
- **Generic Space** includes common structures shared by the input spaces.
- **Blended Space** is where the actual integration and creation of new meaning happen.

## How It Works

The blending process unfolds in stages:

- **Composition** mixes elements from the input spaces.
- **Completion** fills in missing parts using background knowledge.
- **Elaboration** takes the blend further through imaginative thinking and simulation.
