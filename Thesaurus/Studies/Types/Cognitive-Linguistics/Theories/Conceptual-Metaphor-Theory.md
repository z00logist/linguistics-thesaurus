# Conceptual Metaphor Theory

Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT) posits that metaphors are not just linguistic expressions but fundamental cognitive mechanisms that shape our understanding of abstract concepts through more concrete experiences.

> **Lakoff and Johnson (1980):**
> "Our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in nature."

## Essentials

- **Conceptual Metaphor** is understanding one domain in terms of another.
