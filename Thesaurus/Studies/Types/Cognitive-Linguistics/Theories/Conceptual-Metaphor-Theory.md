# Conceptual Metaphor Theory

Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT) posits that metaphors are not just linguistic expressions but fundamental cognitive mechanisms that shape our understanding of abstract concepts through more concrete experiences.

> **Lakoff and Johnson (1980):**
> "Our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in nature."

## Key Concepts

- **Source and Target Domains**: The source domain (concrete experience) is used to understand the target domain (abstract concept).
- **Metaphorical Mappings**: Systematic correspondences between elements of the source and target domains.
- **Embodiment**: Metaphors are grounded in bodily experiences.

## Common Conceptual Metaphors

- **Time is Money**: "You're wasting my time."
- **Love is a Journey**: "Our relationship has hit a dead end."
- **Ideas are Food**: "I can't digest all these facts."
