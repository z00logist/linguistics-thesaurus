# Blending Theory

Blending Theory, also known as Conceptual Integration Theory, is a cognitive framework that describes how elements from different mental spaces are combined to create new meaning.

## Key Components

- **Input Spaces**: Different mental spaces contributing to the blend.
- **Generic Space**: Contains abstract structure common to input spaces.
- **Blended Space**: The mental space where elements are integrated.

## Processes

- **Composition**: Combining elements from input spaces.
- **Completion**: Filling in additional structure using background knowledge.
- **Elaboration**: Developing the blend through imaginative processes.

## Applications

- **Metaphor and Analogy**: Explaining creative thought.
- **Humor**: Understanding jokes and puns.
- **Problem-Solving**: Integrating concepts to find solutions.

## Examples

- **Riddle of the Sphinx**: Blending human and animal characteristics.
- **Advertisements**: Combining product features with desirable lifestyles.
