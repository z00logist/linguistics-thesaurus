# Cognitive Grammar

Cognitive Grammar is a theory developed by Ronald W. Langacker that views grammar as an integral part of cognition, emphasizing the symbolic and conceptual nature of linguistic structures.

## Key Concepts

- **Symbolic Units**: Grammar consists of form-meaning pairings called symbolic units.
- **Usage-Based Model**: Language knowledge emerges from language use.
- **Schemas and Instances**: General patterns (schemas) and specific examples (instances).
- **Continuum of Lexicon and Grammar**: No strict division between lexicon and grammar.

## Principles

- **Construal**: The way speakers perceive and present situations.
- **Figure and Ground**: Focus (figure) versus background (ground) elements in a scene.
- **Domains**: Conceptual contexts that provide meaning (e.g., space, time).
- **Profiling**: Highlighting aspects of a conceptual domain.

## Applications

- **Syntax**: Understanding sentence structures through conceptualization.
- **Morphology**: Analyzing word formation as symbolic assemblies.
- **Semantics**: Interpreting meaning based on cognitive processes.
