# Categorization

Categorization is the cognitive process through which ideas and objects are identified, distinguished, and understood. It is a fundamental aspect of human cognition and plays a crucial role in how we use and comprehend language.

## Essentials

Categorization relies on a few main concepts. Mental representations of categories are known as concepts. The classical theory defines categories using necessary and sufficient features. Prototype theory suggests that categories are based around typical examples that embody the category's characteristics. Exemplar theory proposes that categories are represented by specific instances stored in memory.
