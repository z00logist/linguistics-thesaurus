# Prototype Theory

Prototype Theory is a model of categorization in cognitive science that suggests categories are formed around prototypical examples rather than strict definitions.

## Key Concepts

- **Prototype**: The most central or typical example of a category.
- **Family Resemblance**: Members of a category share overlapping features but not a single defining attribute.
- **Graded Membership**: Some members are better examples of a category than others.

## Examples

- **Birds**: A robin is a prototypical bird, while a penguin is less so.
- **Furniture**: A chair is a prototypical piece of furniture, whereas a lamp is less typical.

## Implications

- **Linguistics**: Explains polysemy and meaning variation.
- **Psychology**: Influences perception and memory.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Affects how categories are represented in models.
