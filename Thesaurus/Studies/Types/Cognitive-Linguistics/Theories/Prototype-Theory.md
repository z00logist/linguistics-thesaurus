# Prototype Theory

Prototype Theory is a way of understanding how we categorize concepts in cognitive science. Instead of using strict definitions, categories are thought to form around central, typical examples.

## Essentials

Prototype Theory highlights a few main ideas:

- **Prototype** refers to the most typical or central example of a category.
- **Family Resemblance** means that members of a category share overlapping characteristics without one defining attribute that all members have.
- **Graded Membership** suggests that some members of a category are seen as better examples than others.

## Examples

Examples of Prototype Theory in action include:

- **Birds**: A robin is often seen as a more typical bird than a penguin, which has more unique features.
- **Furniture**: A chair fits the category more easily than a lamp, showing that categories can have varying levels of typicality.
