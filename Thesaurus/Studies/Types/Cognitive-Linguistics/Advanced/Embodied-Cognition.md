# Embodied Cognition

Embodied cognition is the theory that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the body's interactions with the world, suggesting that the mind is not only connected to the body but that the body influences the mind.

## Key Principles

- **Sensorimotor Experiences**: Cognition is grounded in sensory and motor systems.
- **Body Influence**: Physical states can affect mental states.
- **Environment Interaction**: Cognition arises from interactions with the environment.

## Implications for Language

- **Metaphor Formation**: Abstract concepts understood through physical experiences.
- **Gesture and Language**: Gestures play a role in thinking and communicating.
- **Perception-Action Coupling**: Language comprehension involves simulating actions.

## Examples

- **"Grasping an idea"**: Using physical action to represent understanding.
- **Mood and Posture**: Body posture influencing emotional states and vice versa.
