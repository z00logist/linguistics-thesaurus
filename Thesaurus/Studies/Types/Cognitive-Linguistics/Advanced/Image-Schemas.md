# Image Schemas

Image schemas are recurring, dynamic patterns of our perceptual interactions and motor programs that give coherence to our experience. They are foundational to conceptualization and meaning.

## Characteristics

Image schemas are rooted in bodily experiences and sensorimotor activities, making them inherently embodied. They function as preconceptual structures, working below the level of conscious awareness. These schemas are dynamic, involving elements like movement, force, and spatial relations.

## Common Image Schemas

Some common examples of image schemas include the container schema, which involves the idea of inside, outside, and boundaries. The path schema represents movement from a starting point to a goal. The force schema involves interactions that include force dynamics, while the balance schema relates to the concept of equilibrium.
