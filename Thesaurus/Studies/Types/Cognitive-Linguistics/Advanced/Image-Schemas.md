# Image Schemas

Image schemas are recurring, dynamic patterns of our perceptual interactions and motor programs that give coherence to our experience. They are foundational to conceptualization and meaning.

## Characteristics

- **Embodied**: Rooted in bodily experiences and sensorimotor activities.
- **Preconceptual Structures**: Operate below conscious awareness.
- **Dynamic Patterns**: Include movement, force, and spatial relations.

## Common Image Schemas

- **Container Schema**: Concepts of inside, outside, and boundaries.
- **Path Schema**: Movement from a source to a goal.
- **Force Schema**: Interaction involving force dynamics.
- **Balance Schema**: Concepts of equilibrium.

## Applications

- **Metaphor Formation**: Basis for conceptual metaphors (e.g., "Ideas are objects").
- **Language Understanding**: Explains how abstract concepts are grounded in physical experience.
- **Cognitive Development**: Insight into how children acquire language and concepts.
