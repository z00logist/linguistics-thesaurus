# Event Structure

Event structure in cognitive linguistics refers to the way events are conceptualized and represented in language, including their temporal, aspectual, and causal characteristics.

## Key Concepts

- **Aspectual Classes**: Categories of verbs based on temporal properties (e.g., states, activities).
- **Causation**: How language encodes cause-effect relationships.
- **Telicity**: Whether an event has a natural endpoint.
- **Temporal Sequencing**: Ordering of events in time.

## Theoretical Approaches

- **Vendler's Verb Classes**: Distinguishes between states, activities, accomplishments, achievements.
- **Conceptual Semantics**: Examines how meaning is structured in the mind.
- **Force Dynamics**: Analyzes how entities interact in events.

## Applications

- **Narrative Analysis**: Understanding how stories are constructed.
- **Discourse Coherence**: How event structures contribute to textual cohesion.
- **Language Typology**: Comparing how different languages encode events.
