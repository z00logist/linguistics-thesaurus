# Force Dynamics

Force dynamics is a semantic framework introduced by Leonard Talmy that describes how entities interact with respect to force, including movement, resistance, and causation.

## Key Concepts

- **Agonist and Antagonist**: Entities exerting force (agonist) and counterforce (antagonist).
- **Force Interaction**: Includes causation, prevention, enablement.
- **Modal Verbs**: Reflect force dynamics (e.g., "can," "must," "may").

## Applications

- **Linguistic Analysis**: Understanding verb meanings and event structures.
- **Cognitive Semantics**: Explaining how physical experiences influence language.
- **Metaphorical Extension**: Applying physical force concepts to abstract domains.

## Examples

- **Causation**: "The wind blew the leaves away."
- **Prevention**: "She stopped the ball from rolling."
- **Enablement**: "He allowed the door to remain open."
