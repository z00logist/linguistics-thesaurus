# Force Dynamics

Force dynamics is a semantic framework introduced by Leonard Talmy that describes how entities interact with respect to force, including movement, resistance, and causation.

Force dynamics involves several central ideas:

- **Agonist and Antagonist**: The agonist is the entity exerting force, while the antagonist is the entity that counteracts or resists the force.
- **Force Interaction**: This includes different types of interactions, such as causation, prevention, and enablement.
- **Modal Verbs**: Words like "can," "must," and "may" often reflect underlying force dynamics in language.


## Examples

- **Causation**: "The wind blew the leaves away."
- **Prevention**: "She stopped the ball from rolling."
- **Enablement**: "He allowed the door to remain open."
