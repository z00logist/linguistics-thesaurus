# Radial Categories

Radial categories are conceptual groupings that have a core, prototypical meaning with additional meanings branching out through metaphorical or metonymic connections.

## Characteristics

Radial categories show prototype effects, where some members are more central or typical than others. They often display polysemy, with a single word having multiple, related meanings. New meanings develop from the prototype through cognitive mechanisms that link related concepts.

## Examples

- **"Head"**:
  - **Prototypical Meaning**: Body part.
  - **Extensions**: "Head of the department," "At the head of the table."
- **"Mother"**:
  - **Prototypical**: Biological mother.
  - **Extensions**: "Mother Earth," "Motherboard."

## Cognitive Mechanisms

Radial categories grow through cognitive mechanisms like metaphor, where one domain maps onto another, and metonymy, where one aspect of something refers to the whole. Image schemas provide underlying patterns that influence how meanings extend from the prototype.
