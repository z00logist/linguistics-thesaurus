# Radial Categories

Radial categories are conceptual categories that have a central, prototypical meaning with extended meanings related through metaphorical or metonymic links.

## Characteristics

- **Prototype Effects**: Some members are more central than others.
- **Polysemy**: A single word with multiple related meanings.
- **Extensions**: New meanings develop from the prototype via cognitive mechanisms.

## Examples

- **"Head"**:
  - **Prototypical Meaning**: Body part.
  - **Extensions**: "Head of the department," "At the head of the table."
- **"Mother"**:
  - **Prototypical**: Biological mother.
  - **Extensions**: "Mother Earth," "Motherboard."

## Cognitive Mechanisms

- **Metaphor**: Mapping from one domain to another.
- **Metonymy**: Using one aspect of something to refer to the whole.
- **Image Schemas**: Underlying patterns influencing meaning extensions.
