# Subjectivity and Intersubjectivity

Subjectivity and intersubjectivity in cognitive linguistics refer to the ways language expresses the speaker's perspective (subjectivity) and how shared understanding is established between interlocutors (intersubjectivity).

## Subjectivity

- **Definition**: Linguistic expression of the speaker's feelings, attitudes, and viewpoints.
- **Markers**: Modality, evaluative adjectives, personal pronouns.
- **Examples**:
  - "I think it's going to rain."
  - "Unfortunately, he left early."

## Intersubjectivity

- **Definition**: The mutual, shared understanding and knowledge among language users.
- **Markers**: Discourse markers, shared cultural references, presuppositions.
- **Examples**:
  - "You know, that movie we saw last week."
  - "As we all agree, education is important."
