# Subjectivity and Intersubjectivity

Subjectivity and intersubjectivity in cognitive linguistics deal with how language conveys the speaker's perspective and how shared understanding is established between people during communication.

## Subjectivity

Subjectivity refers to how language expresses the speaker's feelings, attitudes, and viewpoints. This can be marked by modality, the use of evaluative adjectives, or personal pronouns. For example, sentences like "I think it's going to rain" or "Unfortunately, he left early" reflect the speaker's personal stance.

## Intersubjectivity

Intersubjectivity involves the shared understanding and common knowledge between language users. It is often indicated through discourse markers, shared cultural references, or presuppositions. Phrases like "You know, that movie we saw last week" or "As we all agree, education is important" illustrate how speakers create a sense of mutual knowledge.
