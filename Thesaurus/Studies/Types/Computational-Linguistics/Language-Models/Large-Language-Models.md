# Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models are neural network models with a large number of parameters, trained on vast amounts of data to understand and generate human-like text.

## Characteristics

- **Scale**: Billions of parameters (e.g., GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters).
- **Pre-training**: Trained on diverse internet text in a self-supervised manner.
- **Few-Shot Learning**: Capable of performing tasks with minimal examples.

## Notable Models

- **GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3)**: Developed by OpenAI, known for its impressive language generation capabilities.
- **BERT**: Focused on understanding language representations.
- **T5**: Unified framework that converts all NLP problems into a text-to-text format.
