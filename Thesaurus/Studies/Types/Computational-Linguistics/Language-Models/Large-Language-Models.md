# Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models are advanced neural network models with a substantial number of parameters. They are trained on vast amounts of data to understand and produce human-like text.

## What Sets LLMs Apart

These models are notable for their scale, often consisting of billions of parameters. For example, GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters. They undergo pre-training on diverse text from the internet using a self-supervised approach, which allows them to learn language patterns without direct supervision. LLMs are also capable of few-shot learning, performing tasks with minimal examples.
