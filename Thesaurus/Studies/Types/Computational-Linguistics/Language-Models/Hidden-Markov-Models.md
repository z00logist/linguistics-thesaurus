# Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are statistical models that represent systems with unobserved (hidden) states. HMMs are widely used in computational linguistics, speech recognition, and bioinformatics to model sequences of observable events influenced by underlying hidden processes.

## Purpose

- **Sequence Modeling**: Captures temporal dependencies in sequential data, such as words in sentences or phonemes in speech.
- **Prediction**: Estimates the probability of hidden states and transitions, enabling prediction of future events.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies patterns in data with unobservable factors, such as parts of speech in language.

## Components of an HMM

1. **States**: The hidden states of the model, representing unobserved aspects of the process.
2. **Observations**: Observable events or data points generated by the hidden states.
3. **Transition Probabilities**: Probabilities of moving from one state to another.
4. **Emission Probabilities**: Probabilities of each observable outcome given the current hidden state.
5. **Initial Probabilities**: The probability distribution of starting in each state.

## Key Algorithms

- **Forward Algorithm**: Computes the probability of an observed sequence.
- **Viterbi Algorithm**: Finds the most likely sequence of hidden states given an observed sequence, commonly used in speech recognition and part-of-speech tagging.
- **Baum-Welch Algorithm**: An expectation-maximization algorithm used to estimate the parameters of an HMM, particularly for unsupervised learning.
