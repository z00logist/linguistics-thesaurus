# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing is a subfield of artificial intelligence focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

## Main Areas of NLP

- Text processing involves tasks like tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
- Syntactic analysis deals with parsing sentences to grasp their grammatical structure.
- Semantic analysis is about understanding meaning and context within text.
- Pragmatics covers understanding language in real-world context, including idioms and metaphors.

## Common Techniques

- Rule-based approaches rely on handcrafted linguistic rules to process language.
- Statistical methods use probabilistic models to make predictions about language.
- Machine learning approaches train models on large datasets to detect and learn language patterns.
