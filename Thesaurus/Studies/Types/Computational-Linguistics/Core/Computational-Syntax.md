# Computational Syntax

Computational syntax deals with creating models that allow machines to understand and parse the structure of sentences in natural language. This area is essential for building systems that can process language with an understanding of its syntactic properties.

## Main Goals

- Syntactic parsing helps analyze sentences and produce parse trees that represent their structure.
- Developing grammar formalisms that can be used computationally, such as context-free grammars and dependency grammars.
- Addressing and resolving syntactic ambiguities in language to improve parsing accuracy.

## Common Methods

- Rule-based parsers rely on handcrafted grammar rules.
- Statistical parsers use probabilistic models that are trained on annotated text data.
- Neural network parsers leverage deep learning to handle parsing tasks effectively.
