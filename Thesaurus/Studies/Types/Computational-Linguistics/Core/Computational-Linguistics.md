# Computational Linguistics

Computational linguistics is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on using computational methods to model and understand natural language. It covers both theoretical research and practical applications, aiming to deepen our understanding of language through computational techniques and to create systems that can process and generate human language.

## Subfields

- Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves creating algorithms to analyze and process language data.
- Speech recognition and synthesis enable the conversion of spoken language into text and text back into speech.
- Machine translation automates the translation of text or speech from one language to another.
- Computational semantics seeks to represent and interpret meaning using computational methods.
- Computational phonology and morphology model sound patterns and word structures in a language.
