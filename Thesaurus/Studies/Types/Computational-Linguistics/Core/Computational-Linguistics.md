# Computational Linguistics

Computational linguistics is an interdisciplinary field concerned with the computational modeling of natural language. It encompasses both theoretical and applied aspects, aiming to understand language from a computational perspective and to develop applications that process and generate human language.


## Subfields

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Development of algorithms to process and analyze language data.
- **Speech Recognition and Synthesis**: Converting speech to text and vice versa.
- **Machine Translation**: Automatic translation between languages.
- **Computational Semantics**: Understanding and representing meaning computationally.
- **Computational Phonology and Morphology**: Modeling sound patterns and word structures.
