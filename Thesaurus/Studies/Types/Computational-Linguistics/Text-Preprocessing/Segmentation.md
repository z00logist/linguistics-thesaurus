# Segmentation

Segmentation is the process of breaking down text into meaningful units, such as words, sentences, or subwords. This step is essential in many natural language processing tasks, especially for languages like Thai or Chinese where words are not separated by spaces.  
Segmentation plays a critical role in identifying word or subword units within text, helping to understand its structure. It caters to language-specific needs, handling unique spacing and morphological rules. Proper segmentation is foundational for NLP tasks such as translation, sentiment analysis, and entity recognition.

## Common Approaches

Different methods are used for segmentation:
- Rule-based methods apply linguistic and morphological rules that are specific to a language.
- Dictionary-based methods use vocabulary databases to match words and phrases.
- Statistical and machine learning methods predict boundaries based on language patterns.
- Deep learning models use neural networks, which are particularly effective for complex or low-resource languages.

## Examples

- **Thai (ไม่มีการเว้นวรรค)** → Segmentation: **ไม่ / มี / การ / เว้น / วรรค**
- **Chinese (没有空格)** → Segmentation: **没有 / 空格**
