# Text Preprocessing

Text preprocessing is the initial stage in natural language processing where raw text data is cleaned and formatted to make it suitable for computational models.

## Common Steps

- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.
- **Lowercasing**: Converting all text to lowercase to reduce variability.
- **Removing Punctuation**: Eliminating punctuation marks.
- **Removing Stop Words**: Filtering out common words that may not carry significant meaning.
- **Stemming**: Reducing words to their base or root form.
- **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their canonical form based on vocabulary and morphology.
