# Text Preprocessing

Text preprocessing is the first step in natural language processing. It involves cleaning and formatting raw text data to make it suitable for computational models.

## Common Steps

- Tokenization splits text into individual words or tokens.
- Lowercasing converts all text to lowercase, helping to reduce variability.
- Removing punctuation gets rid of punctuation marks.
- Removing stop words filters out common words that may not add significant meaning.
- Stemming reduces words to their base or root form.
- Lemmatization uses vocabulary and morphology to bring words to their canonical form.
