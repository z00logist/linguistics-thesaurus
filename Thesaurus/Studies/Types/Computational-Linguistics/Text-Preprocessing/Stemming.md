# Stemming

Stemming is the process of reducing inflected or derived words to their base or root form. This is usually done by removing prefixes and suffixes.

## Common Algorithms

- The Porter Stemmer is one of the most widely used methods.
- The Snowball Stemmer, which is an improvement over the Porter Stemmer, supports multiple languages.
- The Lancaster Stemmer is an aggressive option that can sometimes over-stem words.

## Examples of Stemming

- "Running" is stemmed to "Run"
- "Connection" is stemmed to "Connect"
- "Studies" is stemmed to "Studi"
