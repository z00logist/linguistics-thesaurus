# Lemmatization

Lemmatization is the process of reducing words to their base or dictionary form, known as a lemma. This technique considers the word's morphological analysis and context to determine the correct base form.

## Purpose

Lemmatization maps inflected words to their base form, making it easier to analyze text consistently. Unlike simple stemming, it takes into account the part of speech and the word's meaning, leading to more accurate results.

## Common Approaches

There are different methods used for lemmatization:
- Rule-based methods apply language-specific morphological rules.
- Dictionary-based methods use vocabulary lists to find the correct lemma.
- Statistical methods leverage machine learning to predict the base forms of words.

## Examples

- **Running** → **Run**
- **Better** → **Good**
- **Studies** → **Study**
