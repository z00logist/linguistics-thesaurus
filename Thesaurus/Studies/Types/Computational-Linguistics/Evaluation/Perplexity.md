# Perplexity

Perplexity is a measurement used to evaluate language models. It indicates how well a probability model predicts a sample. A lower perplexity score suggests that the model has a higher predictive power.

## Calculation

Perplexity is calculated using the formula:

Perplexity = 2^H(p)

Where:
- \( H(p) \) is the entropy of the probability distribution \( p \).

## Purpose

- It provides a way to measure how effectively a language model predicts text.
- It allows for the comparison of different language models to see which one performs better.
