# Word Error Rate (WER)

Word Error Rate (WER) is a common metric for evaluating the accuracy of speech recognition and translation systems by comparing a reference transcript with a hypothesis.

## How It’s Calculated

WER is calculated using the following formula:

WER = (Insertions + Deletions + Substitutions) / Total Words in Reference

## Why It’s Used

- Measures how closely the hypothesis aligns with the reference.
- Helps in evaluating and comparing the performance of different speech recognition systems.
