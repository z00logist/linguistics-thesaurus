# Topic Modeling

Topic modeling is a technique in natural language processing used to discover the hidden thematic structure in large collections of text. By identifying recurring words and patterns, topic modeling can uncover the main topics present within a corpus, aiding in understanding and summarizing large datasets.

## Purpose

- **Identifying Themes**: Extracts topics that characterize the main themes within documents.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduces large corpora to a smaller set of topics, simplifying analysis.
- **Document Clustering**: Groups similar documents based on shared topics, useful for categorization.

## Common Techniques

- **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**: A probabilistic model that assumes each document is a mixture of topics, and each topic is a mixture of words.
- **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**: A linear algebra approach that decomposes document-term matrices into topics and word distributions.
- **Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)**: Reduces dimensionality by identifying patterns in term-document matrices through singular value decomposition (SVD).
