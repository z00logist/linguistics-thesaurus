# Frequency Analysis

Frequency analysis examines how often words or linguistic structures appear in a corpus.

## Purpose

- Helps identify the most common words used in a language.
- Supports vocabulary profiling to assess language complexity and learner vocabulary levels.
- Observes patterns like Zipf's Law, which shows the relationship between word frequency and rank.

## Tools

- Frequency lists, which display words ordered by frequency.
- Statistical software, including R or Python libraries for data analysis.
