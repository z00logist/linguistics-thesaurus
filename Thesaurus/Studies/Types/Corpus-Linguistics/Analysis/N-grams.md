# N-grams

An n-gram is a sequence of n items taken from a given sample of text or speech. N-grams are valuable in corpus linguistics for analyzing language patterns and usage.

## Types

- **Unigrams (1-gram)** are single words.
- **Bigrams (2-grams)** are pairs of consecutive words.
- **Trigrams (3-grams)** are triplets of consecutive words.
- **Higher-order n-grams** consist of sequences with four or more words.
