# N-grams

An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sample of text or speech. In corpus linguistics, n-grams are used to analyze patterns in language data.

## Types

- **Unigrams (1-gram)**: Single words.
- **Bigrams (2-grams)**: Pairs of consecutive words.
- **Trigrams (3-grams)**: Triplets of consecutive words.
- **Higher-order n-grams**: Sequences of four or more words.
