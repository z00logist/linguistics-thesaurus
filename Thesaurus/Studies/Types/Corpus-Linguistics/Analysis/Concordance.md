# Concordance

A concordance is an alphabetical list of principal words used in a text or corpus, displaying each occurrence of a word or phrase in its context.

## Purpose

- Helps analyze how words are used within their context.
- Allows identification of collocations, revealing words that frequently appear together.
- Provides frequency counts, showing how often specific words appear.

## Types

- KWIC (Key Word in Context) format presents the keyword centered within its surrounding text.
- Full-text concordance includes larger excerpts or entire documents where the word occurs.
