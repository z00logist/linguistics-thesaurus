# Concordance

A concordance is an alphabetical list of the principal words used in a text or corpus, showing every contextual occurrence of a word or phrase.

## Purpose

- **Contextual Analysis**: Understand how words are used in context.
- **Collocation Study**: Identify words that frequently occur together.
- **Frequency Counts**: Determine how often a word appears.

## Types

- **KWIC (Key Word in Context)**: Displays the keyword centered with its surrounding context.
- **Full-Text Concordance**: Provides larger excerpts or entire documents where the word appears.

## Tools

- **Concordancers**: Software applications that generate concordances (e.g., AntConc, WordSmith Tools).
