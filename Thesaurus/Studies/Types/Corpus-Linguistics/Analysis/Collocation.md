# Collocation

Collocation refers to the habitual juxtaposition of a particular word with other words, occurring more frequently than by chance.

## Characteristics

- Phrases like "make a decision" and "strong tea" are examples of fixed expressions.
- Words that tend to co-occur more often than by random chance.

## Types

- Grammatical collocations consist of a dominant word such as a noun, verb, or adjective paired with a preposition or grammatical structure (e.g., "depend on").
- Lexical collocations involve two lexical words such as nouns, adjectives, or verbs that frequently appear together (e.g., "heavy rain").
