# Collocation

Collocation refers to the habitual juxtaposition of a particular word with other words with a frequency greater than chance.

## Characteristics

- **Fixed Expressions**: Phrases like "make a decision," "strong tea."
- **Statistical Tendency**: Words that co-occur more often than by random chance.

## Types

- **Grammatical Collocations**: A dominant word (noun, verb, adjective) and a preposition or grammatical structure (e.g., "depend on").
- **Lexical Collocations**: Two lexical words (nouns, adjectives, verbs) that commonly occur together (e.g., "heavy rain").
