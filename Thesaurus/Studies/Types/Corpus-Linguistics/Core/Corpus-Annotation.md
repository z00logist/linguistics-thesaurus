# Corpus Annotation

Corpus annotation involves the addition of linguistic information to a corpus, such as part-of-speech tags, syntactic structures, or semantic roles, to enhance its utility for linguistic research and natural language processing.

## Types of Annotation

- **Part-of-Speech Tagging** assigns grammatical categories to words.
- **Lemmatisation** reduces words to their base or dictionary forms.
- **Parsing** identifies syntactic structures within sentences.
- **Semantic Annotation** includes meanings or sense distinctions for words.
- **Pragmatic Annotation** notes discourse features, such as speech acts.

## Tools

- **Annotation Software** such as UAM CorpusTool and Brat.
- **Tagsets** like the Penn Treebank tagset, providing a standardized system of tags.
