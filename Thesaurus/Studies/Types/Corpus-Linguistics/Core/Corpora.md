# Corpora

A corpus (plural: corpora) is a large and structured set of texts (nowadays usually electronically stored and processed) used for linguistic analysis.

## Types of Corpora

- **Reference Corpora**: General collections representing a language (e.g., British National Corpus).
- **Specialized Corpora**: Focused on specific genres, domains, or registers.
- **Learner Corpora**: Contain language produced by language learners.
- **Spoken Corpora**: Transcriptions of spoken language.
- **Multilingual Corpora**: Contain texts in multiple languages.

## Characteristics

- **Authenticity**: Real-world language use.
- **Representativeness**: Reflects the diversity of the language.
- **Size**: Ranges from thousands to billions of words.

## Examples

- **British National Corpus (BNC)**: A 100-million-word collection of samples of written and spoken English from a wide range of sources.
- **Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA)**: Contains over 560 million words of American English texts.
