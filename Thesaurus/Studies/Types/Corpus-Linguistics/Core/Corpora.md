A corpus (plural: corpora) is a large, structured set of texts, often stored electronically, used for linguistic analysis and research.

- **Spoken Corpora** are made up of transcriptions of spoken language.
- **Multilingual Corpora** include texts in more than one language for comparative studies.

## Characteristics

- **Authenticity** reflects real-world language usage.
