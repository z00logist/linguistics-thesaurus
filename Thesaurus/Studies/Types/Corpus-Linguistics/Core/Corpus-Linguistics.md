# Corpus Linguistics

Corpus linguistics is an empirical approach for studying language through the systematic analysis of large collections of real-life texts, known as corpora.

## Essentials

Corpora are comprehensive, structured collections of texts that serve as the foundation for linguistic analysis. Through them, researchers can explore language patterns and usage.

Concordance refers to listings that display how a word or phrase appears across a corpus, highlighting its context. This helps in understanding the meaning and function of words within sentences.

Collocation points to the tendency of specific words to occur together more frequently than by chance. This habitual pairing enriches understanding of language nuances.

Frequency analysis involves investigating how often words or structures appear within a corpus. This reveals common language elements and helps distinguish between core and peripheral vocabulary.

Annotation adds layers of linguistic information to a corpus, such as part-of-speech tags, syntactic roles, or semantic meanings. These enrich the data, making analysis more detailed and useful.
