# Corpus Linguistics

Corpus linguistics is an empirical approach to studying language that involves the systematic analysis of large collections of naturally occurring texts (corpora).


## Key Concepts

- **Corpora**: Large, structured sets of texts used for linguistic analysis.
- **Concordance**: A list of all the occurrences of a word or phrase in a corpus, along with its context.
- **Collocation**: The habitual juxtaposition of a particular word with other words.
- **Frequency Analysis**: Examining how often words or structures occur.
- **Annotation**: Adding linguistic information to a corpus (e.g., part-of-speech tags).
