# Zipf's Law

Zipf's Law is an empirical law that describes the frequency distribution of words in a language, stating that the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table.

## Formula

- **Frequency ‚àù 1 / Rank**

## Implications

- **Few High-Frequency Words**: A small number of words occur very frequently.
- **Many Low-Frequency Words**: A large number of words occur rarely.
- **Vocabulary Acquisition**: Understanding which words are most important to learn.

## Examples

- The most common word (e.g., "the") might occur thousands of times, while less common words might occur only once.
