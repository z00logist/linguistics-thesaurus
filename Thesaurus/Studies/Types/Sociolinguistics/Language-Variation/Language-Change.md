# Language Change

Language change is the evolution of language forms and structures over time, influenced by social, cultural, and cognitive factors.

## Types of Language Change

- **Morphological Change**: Changes in word formation and inflection.
- **Syntactic Change**: Changes in sentence structure.
- **Semantic Change**: Changes in word meanings.
- **Lexical Change**: Addition or loss of vocabulary.

## Factors Influencing Change

- **Social Interaction**: Contact with other languages and dialects.
- **Technological Advancements**: New concepts require new terms.
- **Cultural Shifts**: Changes in societal values and norms.

## Examples

- **Old English to Modern English**: Significant changes in grammar and vocabulary.
- **Borrowing**: Adoption of words from other languages (e.g., "sushi" from Japanese).
