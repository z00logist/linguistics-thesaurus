# Code-Switching

Code-switching involves alternating between two or more languages or dialects within a conversation or utterance.

## Reasons for Code-Switching

- **Contextual Shifts**: Changing topics or addressing different audiences.
- **Emphasis**: Highlighting a point or expressing emotion.
- **Identity Expression**: Reflecting cultural or social identity.

## Types

- **Inter-Sentential**: Switching occurs at sentence boundaries.
- **Intra-Sentential**: Switching occurs within a single sentence.
- **Tag-Switching**: Insertion of a tag phrase from another language.

## Examples

- **Spanglish**: Mixing Spanish and English in conversation.
- **Singlish**: Combining English with elements of Chinese, Malay, and Tamil in Singapore.
