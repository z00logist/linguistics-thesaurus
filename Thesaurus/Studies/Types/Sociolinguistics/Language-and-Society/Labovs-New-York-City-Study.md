# Labov's New York City Study

William Labov’s 1966 study on how New Yorkers pronounced the post-vocalic /r/ in department stores is a cornerstone of sociolinguistics. This research showcased how linguistic variation ties into social class.

## Background

Labov's focus was on the post-vocalic /r/—the /r/ sound that comes after a vowel, as in words like “car” or “four.” In New York City, some speakers dropped the /r/ (non-rhotic pronunciation), while others pronounced it clearly (rhotic pronunciation). This difference in speech was linked to social identity and prestige.

## Methodology

Labov’s approach was innovative. He conducted a rapid, anonymous survey in three department stores, each representing a different social tier:

- **Saks Fifth Avenue** for the upper class
- **Macy's** for the middle class
- **S. Klein** for the lower class

Labov's key question to sales assistants was one that naturally prompted the phrase "fourth floor," giving him two instances to observe the use of the post-vocalic /r/.

## Findings

The results were striking. The use of /r/ varied by store, reflecting social status:

- Employees at **Saks Fifth Avenue** used the rhotic /r/ most frequently, aligning with their higher social status.
- **Macy’s** employees showed an interesting pattern. When asked to repeat, they often increased their use of /r/, revealing a level of linguistic insecurity and a desire to sound more prestigious.
- **S. Klein** staff, representing the lower social tier, pronounced /r/ the least.

Labov also observed style shifting: when asked to repeat the phrase, many employees heightened their rhoticity, showing they were aware of the social value attached to pronouncing the /r/.

Labov's study demonstrated that language use reflects social hierarchy. It was one of the first to provide solid evidence of social stratification in linguistic behavior. The study also introduced the concept of linguistic insecurity, where individuals adjust their speech to meet perceived social expectations. Labov’s method of rapid, anonymous surveys became a standard in sociolinguistic research.
