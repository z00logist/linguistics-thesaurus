# Sociolinguistics

Sociolinguistics examines the interplay between language and society, revealing how social factors influence linguistic variation and change.

> **Spolsky, 1998:**
> "Sociolinguistics is the field that studies the relationship between language and society, between the uses of language and the social structures in which the users of language live."

## Key Concepts

- **Language Variation**: Differences in language use among different social groups.
- **Language Change**: How languages evolve over time within societies.
- **Dialectology**: Study of regional language variations.
- **Code-Switching**: Alternating between languages or dialects in conversation.
- **Language and Identity**: How language shapes and reflects social identity.

## Key Studies

- **Labov's New York City Study**: Demonstrated the relationship between social class and linguistic variation in the pronunciation of the post-vocalic /r/.
