# Sociolinguistic Variables

A sociolinguistic variable is a linguistic feature that varies among speakers and correlates with social factors like region, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, or gender.

## Definition

A linguistic variable is an element of language that can have different forms among speakers. These different forms are known as variants. The way speakers choose between these variants can reflect their social identity or group membership.

## Examples

Sociolinguistic variables can be seen in different contexts:

- The **post-vocalic /r/** in New York City, where some speakers pronounce the /r/ in words like "car" and "four," while others drop it.
- The **(-ing) ending**, where "running" might be pronounced as [rʌnɪŋ] or [rʌnɪn].
- **Th-fronting**, where a word like "think" is pronounced as "fink."

## Related Studies

Several classic studies highlight the importance of sociolinguistic variables:

- **Martha's Vineyard Study**, where William Labov examined how vowel centralization was tied to local identity on the island.
- **The Belfast Study** by Lesley Milroy, which looked at how language variation was influenced by social networks in Northern Ireland.
