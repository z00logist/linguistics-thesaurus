# Semantics

Semantics is the study of meaning in language. It examines how words and sentences convey meaning, how meaning is structured, and how it is interpreted by speakers and listeners.

## Key Areas

- **Lexical Semantics**: The meaning of words and the relationships between them.
- **Compositional Semantics**: How meanings of individual words combine in phrases and sentences.
- **Pragmatics**: The study of how context influences meaning.
- **Semantic Roles**: The functions that participants have in the events described by sentences.

## Key Concepts

- **Meaning**: The information conveyed by words and sentences.
- **Sense and Reference**: Distinction between the inherent meaning of a word (sense) and the actual object or concept it refers to (reference).
- **Polysemy and Homonymy**: Words with multiple related meanings (polysemy) and words that sound the same but have unrelated meanings (homonymy).
- **Synonymy and Antonymy**: Words with similar meanings (synonyms) and opposite meanings (antonyms).

## Importance

- **Communication**: Understanding semantics is crucial for effective communication.
- **Language Learning**: Helps in acquiring vocabulary and understanding nuances.
- **Computational Linguistics**: Essential for natural language processing and AI.

## Applications

- **Lexicography**: Compiling dictionaries and thesauri.
- **Translation Studies**: Ensuring accurate translation of meaning across languages.
- **Language Teaching**: Assisting learners in grasping meanings and usage.
