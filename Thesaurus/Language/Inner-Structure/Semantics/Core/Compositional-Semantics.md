# Compositional Semantics

Compositional semantics, also known as formal semantics, is the study of how meanings of individual words combine to form the meanings of larger linguistic units like phrases and sentences.

## Principle of Compositionality

- **Definition**: The meaning of a complex expression is determined by its structure and the meanings of its constituents.
- **Attributed to**: Gottlob Frege, a foundational concept in semantics.

## Key Concepts

- **Syntax-Semantics Interface**: The relationship between syntactic structures and semantic interpretation.
- **Semantic Rules**: Guidelines for combining meanings based on grammatical structure.
- **Type Theory**: A formal framework for categorizing expressions and their meanings.

## Examples

- **Simple Sentence**: "The cat sleeps."
  - **Meaning**: The entity referred to as "the cat" performs the action "sleeps."
- **Complex Sentence**: "Every student passed the exam."
  - **Quantifiers**: Words like "every," "some," and "no" affect meaning and require special semantic treatment.

## Applications

- **Logic and Philosophy**: Understanding logical form and entailment.
- **Computational Linguistics**: Natural language understanding and machine translation.
- **Language Teaching**: Explaining how sentence structures affect meaning.
