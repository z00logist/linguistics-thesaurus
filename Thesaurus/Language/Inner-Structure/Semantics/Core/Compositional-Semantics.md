# Compositional Semantics

Compositional semantics, often referred to as formal semantics, examines how the meanings of individual words combine to create the meanings of larger linguistic units such as phrases and sentences.

## Principle of Compositionality

The central idea in compositional semantics is the principle of compositionality, which states that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by its structure and the meanings of its parts. This principle is often attributed to Gottlob Frege and forms a foundational aspect of semantic theory.

## Key Concepts

Compositional semantics involves several core concepts:

- The **Syntax-Semantics Interface** explores how syntactic structures map onto semantic interpretations.
- **Semantic Rules** provide a framework for combining meanings in accordance with grammatical structures.
- **Type Theory** categorizes expressions and their meanings, aiding in the formal representation of language.
