# Sense and Reference

Sense and reference are Essentials in semantics that differentiate between the meaning of a linguistic expression and the actual entity it refers to in the world.

## Sense

Sense refers to the inherent meaning or the mental concept associated with a word or phrase. It is abstract and not tied to any specific real-world instance. Dictionary definitions often capture the sense of a word.

### Example
The phrases "morning star" and "evening star" both refer to the planet Venus, but their sense conveys different meanings related to the times of observation.

## Reference

Reference denotes the actual entity or object that a word or phrase refers to in the real world. It is concrete and can vary depending on the context.

### Example
The phrase "the current president" points to a specific person, but the actual individual changes over time as different people hold the office.

## Theories

- **Frege's Distinction** was introduced by Gottlob Frege in 1892, establishing the foundational ideas of sense and reference.
- **Russell's Theory of Descriptions** provides insight into how language connects to real-world entities and how definite descriptions function in discourse.
