# Lexical Semantics

Lexical semantics studies how words in a language denote meaning and the relationships among those words. It aims to understand the meanings of individual words and how they relate to each other.

## Essentials

Lexical semantics explores several fundamental ideas:

- **Word Meaning**: Examining the inherent meanings of words.
- **Semantic Relations** include:
  - **Synonymy**, where words have similar meanings (e.g., "big" and "large").
  - **Antonymy**, where words have opposite meanings (e.g., "hot" and "cold").
  - **Hyponymy**, which describes hierarchical relationships where one word is a type of another (e.g., "rose" as a type of "flower").
  - **Meronymy**, involving part-whole relationships (e.g., "wheel" as part of "car").
- **Polysemy** refers to a single word that has multiple related meanings, such as "bank," which can mean a financial institution or a riverbank.
- **Homonymy** involves words that are spelled or pronounced the same but have unrelated meanings, like "bat" (the animal) and "bat" (used in sports).
