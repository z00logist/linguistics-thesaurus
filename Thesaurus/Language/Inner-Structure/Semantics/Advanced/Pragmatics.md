# Pragmatics

Pragmatics is the branch of linguistics concerned with language use in context and the ways in which context contributes to meaning.

## Key Concepts

- **Context**: The situation in which communication occurs, including physical, social, and cultural factors.
- **Speech Acts**: Actions performed via utterances (e.g., requesting, promising).
- **Implicature**: Meaning implied but not explicitly stated.
- **Deixis**: Words and phrases that cannot be fully understood without contextual information (e.g., "this," "here," "now").
- **Presupposition**: Assumptions made by speakers that are taken for granted.

## Theories

- **Grice's Cooperative Principle**: Speakers and listeners cooperate in communication, adhering to maxims of quality, quantity, relevance, and manner.
- **Relevance Theory**: Proposes that human communication is guided by the expectation of relevance.

## Applications

- **Discourse Analysis**: Studying language use in texts and conversations.
- **Language Teaching**: Teaching language functions and appropriate usage.
- **Computational Linguistics**: Developing systems that can understand and generate contextually appropriate responses.
