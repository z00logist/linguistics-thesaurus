# Pragmatics

Pragmatics is a branch of linguistics that explores how language is used in context and how context influences meaning.

## Key Concepts

Pragmatics involves several essential ideas:

- **Context** refers to the circumstances surrounding communication, including physical, social, and cultural elements.
- **Speech Acts** are actions carried out through language, such as making requests or promises.
- **Implicature** involves meaning that is suggested but not directly stated.
- **Deixis** includes words or phrases that require contextual information to be understood (e.g., "this," "here," "now").
- **Presupposition** encompasses assumptions that speakers make and expect listeners to recognize as given.

## Theories

Some important theories in pragmatics include:

- **Grice's Cooperative Principle**, which suggests that speakers and listeners collaborate during communication, following maxims related to quality, quantity, relevance, and manner.
- **Relevance Theory**, which proposes that communication is driven by the expectation of relevance and the effort to convey and interpret meaningful information efficiently.
