# Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM)

The Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) is a linguistic theory developed by Anna Wierzbicka and colleagues, proposing that all meanings can be broken down into a set of universal semantic building blocks called semantic primitives or primes.

## Key Concepts

NSM centers around a few core ideas:

- **Semantic Primes** are basic, universal meanings that exist across all languages. Examples include simple concepts like "I," "you," "someone," "something," "good," and "bad."
- **Reductive Paraphrase** is the process of explaining complex meanings using only these semantic primes.
- NSM highlights the strong connection between **language, thought, and culture**, showing how universal meanings are expressed differently across cultures.

## Semantic Primes

Some common semantic primes include:

- **Substantives**: I, you, someone, something, people.
- **Determiners**: This, the same, other.
- **Quantifiers**: One, two, some, all, many.
- **Evaluators**: Good, bad.
- **Descriptors**: Big, small.
- **Mental Predicates**: Think, know, want, feel, see, hear.
- **Speech**: Say, words, true.

*(The list continues to cover approximately 65 primes.)*
