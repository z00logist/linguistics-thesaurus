# Semantic Fields

A semantic field is a group of words that share a related meaning, referring to a specific topic or area of knowledge. This concept helps illustrate how vocabulary is structured and organized within a language.

## Key Concepts

Semantic fields encompass a few important ideas:

- **Lexical Field** is another term used for semantic field, highlighting the grouping of words based on shared meaning.
- **Hyponymy** describes the relationship where one term falls under a broader category (e.g., "rose" is a type of "flower").
- **Semantic Relations** include synonymy, antonymy, and other relationships among words within the field.

## Examples

- **Color Terms**: Red, blue, green, yellow.
- **Kinship Terms**: Mother, father, brother, sister.
- **Emotions**: Happiness, sadness, anger, fear.
