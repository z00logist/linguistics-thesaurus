# Semantic Roles

Semantic roles, also known as thematic roles or theta roles, describe the functions that participants have in the events or situations described by a sentence.

## Common Semantic Roles

- **Agent**: The doer of an action (e.g., "John" in "John kicked the ball").
- **Patient**: The entity that is affected by the action (e.g., "the ball" in "John kicked the ball").
- **Experiencer**: One who perceives or experiences something (e.g., "She" in "She felt happy").
- **Instrument**: The means by which an action is performed (e.g., "with a knife" in "He cut the bread with a knife").
- **Beneficiary**: The entity that benefits from an action (e.g., "for her friend" in "She baked a cake for her friend").
- **Location**: Where the action takes place (e.g., "in the park" in "They played in the park").
- **Source**: The starting point of movement (e.g., "from the station" in "She walked from the station").
- **Goal**: The endpoint of movement (e.g., "to the store" in "He drove to the store").

## Importance

- **Understanding Sentence Meaning**: Helps in interpreting who did what to whom.
- **Syntax-Semantics Interface**: Semantic roles influence syntactic structure.
- **Language Learning**: Assists learners in grasping sentence construction.

## Applications

- **Computational Linguistics**: Semantic role labeling in natural language processing.
- **Language Teaching**: Clarifying sentence elements and their functions.
- **Linguistic Analysis**: Studying argument structure and verb valency.
