# Formal Semantics

Formal semantics studies linguistic meaning using formal tools drawn from logic and mathematics. Its goal is to model how speakers understand and interpret sentences in a systematic way.

## Essentials

Some of the main ideas in formal semantics include:

- **Model-Theoretic Semantics** involves using models to represent possible worlds and assess the truth conditions of sentences.
- **Truth-Conditional Semantics** assigns truth values to sentences based on their meaning and the context in which they are used.
- **Lambda Calculus** is a formal system used to express computations through function abstraction and application.
- **Type Theory** categorizes expressions into types to ensure correct semantic composition.

## Approaches

Formal semantics encompasses different methods, such as:

- **Montague Grammar**, developed by Richard Montague, which merges formal logic with natural language semantics.
- **Possible Worlds Semantics**, which analyzes meaning by considering different potential states of the world.
