# Articulation

Articulation refers to the physical movement of speech organs (e.g., tongue, lips, palate) to produce speech sounds.

## Speech Organs

- **Tongue**
- **Lips**
- **Teeth**
- **Alveolar Ridge**
- **Hard Palate**
- **Soft Palate (Velum)**
- **Glottis**

## Places of Articulation

- **Bilabial**: Both lips (e.g., /p/, /b/)
- **Labiodental**: Lower lip and upper teeth (e.g., /f/, /v/)
- **Dental**: Tongue and teeth (e.g., /θ/ as in "think")
- **Alveolar**: Tongue and alveolar ridge (e.g., /t/, /d/, /s/, /z/)
- **Palatal**: Tongue and hard palate (e.g., /ʃ/ as in "she")
- **Velar**: Tongue and soft palate (e.g., /k/, /g/)
- **Glottal**: Glottis (e.g., /h/)

## Manners of Articulation

- **Stop (Plosive)**: Complete closure followed by release (e.g., /p/, /t/, /k/)
- **Fricative**: Narrowing of the vocal tract causing friction (e.g., /f/, /s/, /ʃ/)
- **Affricate**: Combination of stop and fricative (e.g., /tʃ/ as in "church")
- **Nasal**: Airflow through the nose (e.g., /m/, /n/)
- **Liquid**: Partial closure allowing air to flow around the tongue (e.g., /l/, /r/)
- **Glide (Approximant)**: Slight constriction (e.g., /w/, /j/)
