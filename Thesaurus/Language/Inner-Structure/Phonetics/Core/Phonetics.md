# Phonetics

Phonetics is the study of the physical properties of speech sounds, focusing on their production, acoustic characteristics, and how they are perceived by listeners. It encompasses three main areas: articulatory phonetics (how sounds are made), acoustic phonetics (the sound wave properties), and auditory phonetics (the perception of these sounds).

> *Ladefoged and Johnson (2014) describe phonetics as*: "Phonetics is the science concerned with the physical properties of speech sounds."

## Branches of Phonetics

Phonetics is divided into:

- **Articulatory Phonetics**, which looks at how speech sounds are formed through the movement of speech organs.
- **Acoustic Phonetics**, focusing on the sound waves and physical properties of these sounds.
- **Auditory Phonetics**, which studies how listeners perceive speech sounds.

## Key Concepts

Some essential concepts in phonetics include:

- **Articulation**, which is the movement and coordination of speech organs to create sounds.
- **Vowels and Consonants**, the basic categories for classifying speech sounds based on how they are produced.
- The **International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)**, a widely used system for transcribing the sounds of speech.
