# International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)

The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is a system of phonetic notation used to represent the sounds of spoken languages in a standardized way.

## Purpose

The IPA is designed to be universal, providing a consistent method for transcribing the sounds of any language. Each symbol in the IPA corresponds to a unique sound, ensuring precision and clarity in phonetic representation.

## Components

The IPA is made up of:

- Symbols for consonants that reflect different places and manners of articulation.
- Symbols for vowels that show variations in tongue position and lip rounding.
- Diacritics that modify sounds to show features like nasalization, length, or tone.

## Usage

The IPA has several practical applications:

- In linguistics, it is used for phonetic transcription and the detailed study of speech sounds.
- For language learners, it helps illustrate accurate pronunciation.
- In speech therapy, it aids in diagnosing and treating speech disorders by providing a clear representation of sounds.
