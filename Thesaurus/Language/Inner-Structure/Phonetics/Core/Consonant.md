## Classification

Consonants can be categorized by:

- **Place of Articulation**, indicating where in the vocal tract the constriction happens.
- **Manner of Articulation**, describing how the airflow is controlled or blocked.
- **Voicing**, which identifies if the vocal cords vibrate during the sound's production.

## Examples in English

Some common examples include:

- Bilabial stops like /p/ (voiceless) and /b/ (voiced).
- Alveolar fricatives such as /s/ (voiceless) and /z/ (voiced).
- The velar nasal /Å‹/, heard in words like "sing."
