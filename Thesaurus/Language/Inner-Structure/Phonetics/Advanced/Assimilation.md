# Assimilation

Assimilation is a phonetic process where a sound changes to become more like a neighboring sound.

## Types

- **Regressive** -- а sound is influenced by a following sound.
- **Progressive** -- а sound is influenced by a preceding sound.
- **Contact** -- sounds directly next to each other influence each other.
- **Distant** -- sounds not directly adjacent influence each other (less common).

## Examples

- **English**:
  - "Input" pronounced as [ɪmpʊt], where /n/ becomes [m] before /p/.
  - "Handbag" often pronounced as [ˈhæmbæɡ].
