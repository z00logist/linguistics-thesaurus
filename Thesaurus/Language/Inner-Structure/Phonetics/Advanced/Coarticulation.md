# Coarticulation

Coarticulation is the phenomenon where speech sounds overlap and influence each other during speech production.

## Types

- **Anticipatory (Forward) Coarticulation** -- a speech sound is influenced by a following sound.
- **Perseverative (Backward) Coarticulation** -- a speech sound is influenced by a preceding sound.

## Examples

- **"Key" vs. "Cool"**:
  - The /k/ sound is produced more forward in the mouth in "key" due to the front vowel /i/, and further back in "cool" due to the back vowel /u/.
