# Phrase Structure Rules

Phrase structure rules describe the possible structures of phrases and sentences in a language, often represented in tree diagrams. They specify how constituents combine hierarchically.

## Examples

- **English NP Rule**:
  - *NP → Det N*
  - A noun phrase (NP) consists of a determiner (Det) followed by a noun (N).

- **English Sentence Rule**:
  - *S → NP VP*
  - A sentence (S) consists of a noun phrase (NP) followed by a verb phrase (VP).
