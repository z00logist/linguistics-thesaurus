# Dependency Grammar

Dependency grammar is a type of syntax theory that focuses on the relationships between words, where structure is determined by dependencies rather than phrase structure.

## Characteristics

Dependency grammar has a few distinctive features:

- Each word in a sentence (a dependent) is linked to another word, called the head, forming a hierarchy.
- Unlike constituency grammar, dependency grammar does not use phrasal categories or phrase nodes.
- The sentence is represented as a connected tree structure, with one root, usually the main verb, connecting all other words.
