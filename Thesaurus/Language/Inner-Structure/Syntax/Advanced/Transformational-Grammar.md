# Transformational Grammar

Transformational grammar, introduced by Noam Chomsky, is a theory that explores how the deep structures of sentences can be transformed into surface structures using specific grammatical rules.

## Essentials

Transformational grammar is built on several core ideas:

- Deep structure represents the underlying syntactic framework of a sentence.
- Surface structure is the form of a sentence that results after applying transformational rules.
- Transformations are the rules or processes that modify deep structures to produce surface structures.

## Examples

An example of transformational grammar is the passive transformation:

- Active: "The cat chased the mouse."
- Passive: "The mouse was chased by the cat."
