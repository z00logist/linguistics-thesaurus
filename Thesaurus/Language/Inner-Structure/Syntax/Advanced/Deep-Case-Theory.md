# Deep Case Theory

Deep Case Theory, proposed by Charles J. Fillmore in 1968, is a model in syntax that emphasizes the underlying semantic roles (cases) that nouns play in sentences.

The theory is built around several key ideas:

- Case grammar emphasizes the relationship between verbs and nouns, focusing on their semantic roles.
- Deep cases refer to abstract roles such as Agent, Patient, Instrument, Beneficiary, and others that explain how nouns function semantically within a sentence.
- The distinction between surface structure and deep structure shows the difference between the syntactic form of a sentence and its deeper semantic representation.


## Deep Cases

- Agentive (A), representing the doer of an action.
- Instrumental (I), indicating the means used to perform an action.
- Dative (D), referring to the entity indirectly affected by an action.
- Factitive (F), describing the object that results from an action.
- Locative (L), specifying the location where an action takes place.
- Objective (O), pointing to the entity directly affected by an action.
