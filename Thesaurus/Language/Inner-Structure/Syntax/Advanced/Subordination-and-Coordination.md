# Subordination and Coordination

These are mechanisms for combining clauses in sentences.

## Coordination

- **Definition**: Links clauses or phrases of equal grammatical status.
- **Coordinating Conjunctions**: "and," "but," "or"
- **Example**:
  - "She likes tea *and* he likes coffee."

## Subordination

- **Definition**: Combines a main clause with one or more subordinate (dependent) clauses.
- **Subordinating Conjunctions**: "because," "although," "if"
- **Example**:
  - "She left early *because* she was tired."

## Importance

- **Complex Sentences**: Allows for the expression of more complex ideas.
- **Syntax Structures**: Helps in understanding clause relationships.
