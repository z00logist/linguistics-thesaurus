# Subordination and Coordination

Subordination and coordination are two ways of combining clauses in sentences to create more complex structures.

## Coordination

Coordination involves linking clauses or phrases that have equal grammatical status. This is typically done using coordinating conjunctions like "and," "but," and "or."

### Example
- "She likes tea *and* he likes coffee."

## Subordination

Subordination connects a main clause with one or more subordinate (dependent) clauses, allowing for a hierarchy of importance within the sentence. Subordinating conjunctions such as "because," "although," and "if" are used.

### Example
- "She left early *because* she was tired."
