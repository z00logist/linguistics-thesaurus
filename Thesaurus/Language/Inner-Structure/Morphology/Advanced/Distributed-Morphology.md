# Distributed Morphology

Distributed Morphology is a theoretical framework that integrates morphology into the syntax, proposing that morphological processes occur throughout the syntactic derivation.

## Essentials

- Morphological forms are inserted after syntactic structure is built.
- Features that drive both syntax and morphology.
- Abstract morphemes realized by specific phonological forms.

## Operations

- **Fusion** -- combining adjacent morphemes into a single node.
- **Fission** -- splitting a single morpheme into multiple nodes.
- **Impoverishment** -- deleting features to resolve conflicts.
