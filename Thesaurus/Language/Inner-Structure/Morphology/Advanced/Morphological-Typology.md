# Morphological Typology

Morphological typology is the classification of languages based on their morphological structure, particularly how they use morphemes to form words.

## Types of Morphological Languages

- **[Isolating Languages](../../../../Language/Types/Core/Isolating.md)**
- **[Agglutinative Languages](../../../../Language/Types/Core/Agglutinative.md)**
  - Example: Turkish
- **[Fusional Languages](../../../../Language/Types/Core/Fusional.md)**
  - Example: Russian
- **[Polysynthetic Languages](../../../../Language/Types/Core/Polysynthetic.md)**
  - Example: Inuktitut
