# Morpheme

The smallest grammatical unit in a language that carries meaning. Morphemes can be roots, prefixes, suffixes, infixes, or circumfixes.

> **Katamba (1993):**
> "Morphemes are the minimal units of meaning or grammatical function."

## Types of Morphemes

- **Free Morphemes**: Can stand alone as words (e.g., "book").
- **Bound Morphemes**: Cannot stand alone and must be attached to other morphemes (e.g., "-s" in "books").

## Examples

- **"Unhappy"**:
  - "un-" (bound morpheme, prefix)
  - "happy" (free morpheme, root)
