# Word Formation

Word formation refers to the processes by which new words are created in a language.

## Processes

### Derivation

- Creating new words by adding derivational morphemes.
- **Examples**:
  - "Happy" → "Unhappy"
  - "Teach" → "Teacher"

### Compounding

- Combining two or more free morphemes to create a new word.
- **Examples**:
  - "Notebook" (note + book)
  - "Sunflower" (sun + flower)

### Conversion

- Changing the word class without altering its form.
- **Examples**:
  - "Email" (noun) → "Email" (verb)

### Reduplication

- Repeating a whole or part of a word.
- **Examples**:
  - In Indonesian: "orang" (person) → "orang-orang" (people)

### Blending

- Merging parts of words into one.
- **Examples**:
  - "Smoke" + "Fog" → "Smog"
