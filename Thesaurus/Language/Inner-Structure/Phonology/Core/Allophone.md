# Allophone

Allophones are different variations of a single phoneme that appear in various contexts without changing the word's meaning.

## Characteristics

- Allophones often occur in specific phonetic environments, known as complementary distribution.
- In some cases, they can be used interchangeably, a situation called free variation, without altering the word's meaning.
- Unlike phonemes, allophones do not create contrasts between words; they are non-contrastive.

## Examples

In English, the phoneme /t/ can be realized in different ways:

- As an aspirated [tʰ] in words like "top"
- As an unaspirated [t] in "stop"
- As a flapped [ɾ] in "butter"
