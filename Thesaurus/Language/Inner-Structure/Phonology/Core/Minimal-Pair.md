# Minimal Pair

A minimal pair is made up of two words that differ by just one phoneme, showing that these sounds function as distinct phonemes within a language.

## Purpose

Minimal pairs are important in phonemic analysis to help identify which sounds are phonemes in a given language. They are also useful in language teaching, aiding learners in recognizing and producing similar sounds more accurately.

## Examples in English

Some common examples include:

- "Bat" and "Pat" highlight the difference between /b/ and /p/.
- "Ship" and "Sheep" contrast /ɪ/ with /iː/.
- "Cat" and "Cut" show the distinction between /æ/ and /ʌ/.
