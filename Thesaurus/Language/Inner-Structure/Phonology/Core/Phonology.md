# Phonology

Phonology is the study of how sounds function within a particular language, focusing on the system and patterns of sounds that convey meaning.

> **Hayes (2009):**
> "Phonology examines the abstract, grammatical characterization of systems of sounds or signs."

## Key Concepts

Phonology includes several important concepts:

- Phonemes are the smallest units of sound that can differentiate meaning.
- Allophones are variations of a single phoneme that do not alter meaning.
- Phonotactics refers to the rules that determine which sound combinations are allowed.
- Phonological processes are patterns of sound changes, such as assimilation or palatalization.
