# Phoneme

A phoneme is the smallest unit of sound in a language that can change the meaning of a word.


## Characteristics

Phonemes are abstract units, represented by slashes (e.g., /p/ or /b/). Each phoneme has distinctive features that set it apart from others, making it possible to differentiate between words, such as in minimal pairs.

## Examples

Some examples include:

- The difference between /p/ and /b/ can be seen in the words "pat" and "bat."
- The sounds /s/ and /z/ create different meanings in "sip" and "zip."
