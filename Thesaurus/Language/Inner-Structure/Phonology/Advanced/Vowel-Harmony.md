# Vowel Harmony

Vowel harmony is a phonological process where the vowels within a word match in certain features like frontness or roundness.

## Characteristics

- Vowels within a word share specific features, creating uniformity.
- This process can affect the form of affixes, adjusting them to align with the root word's vowel features.

## Examples

- In Turkish, the plural suffix "-ler" or "-lar" depends on the vowel in the root word:
  - "Kitap" (book) becomes "Kitaplar" (books)
  - "Ev" (house) becomes "Evler" (houses)
- Finnish also uses vowel harmony, with suffixes adapting to match either front or back vowels in the root.
