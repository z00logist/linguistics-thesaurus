# Phonotactics

Phonotactics refers to the rules governing the permissible combinations and sequences of sounds in a particular language.

## Characteristics

- **Language-Specific**: Phonotactic rules vary between languages.
- **Syllable Structure**: Defines what consonant and vowel patterns are allowed.
- **Constraints**: May prohibit certain sound clusters.

## Examples

- **English**:
  - Allows "str-" at the beginning of words (e.g., "street")
  - Does not allow "ng-" at the beginning of words.
- **Japanese**:
  - Syllables typically follow a consonant-vowel (CV) pattern.
  - Does not allow consonant clusters at the beginning of words.

## Importance

- **Language Acquisition**: Helps learners predict permissible words.
- **Speech Disorders**: Phonotactic constraints may affect speech development.
- **Loanwords**: Adapted to fit the phonotactic rules of the borrowing language.
