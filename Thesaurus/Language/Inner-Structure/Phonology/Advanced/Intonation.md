# Intonation

Intonation is the variation of pitch in speech, which can convey different meanings, emotions, or grammatical information.

## Functions

Intonation serves multiple roles in communication. It helps differentiate between sentence types, such as distinguishing a question from a statement. It also conveys the speaker's emotions and attitudes, adding layers like surprise or sarcasm to the message. Additionally, it signals whether the speaker is continuing their thought or finishing their statement.

## Examples in English

Intonation patterns can change the meaning or intent of a sentence:

- **Rising Intonation** is commonly used for yes/no questions.
  - Example: "You're coming?" (with a rising pitch at the end)
- **Falling Intonation** is typical for statements and commands.
  - Example: "She left early." (with a falling pitch at the end)
