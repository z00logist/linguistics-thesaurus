# Phonological Processes

Phonological processes are systematic sound changes that occur within a language's phonological system.

## Types of Phonological Processes

There are several common types of phonological processes: 
- Assimilation happens when a sound becomes more similar to a neighboring sound, while dissimilation makes a sound less like the surrounding ones.   
- Insertion, or epenthesis, refers to adding an extra sound, whereas deletion, or elision, involves omitting a sound.   
- Metathesis is when sounds are reordered, and palatalization occurs when consonants shift closer to palatal sounds.

## Examples

- **Assimilation**:
  - "Input" pronounced as [ɪmpʊt]
- **Deletion**:
  - Silent 'k' in "knight"
- **Metathesis**:
  - Old English "brid" became "bird"
