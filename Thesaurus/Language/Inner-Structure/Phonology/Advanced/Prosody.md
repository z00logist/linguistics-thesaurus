# Prosody

Prosody refers to the rhythm, stress, and intonation in speech, adding meaning that goes beyond individual sounds and words.

## Components

- Intonation involves variations in pitch throughout a sentence.
- Stress highlights particular syllables or words for emphasis.
- Rhythm creates a pattern of beats or timing in speech.
- Tone uses pitch to convey word meanings, especially in tonal languages.

## Functions

- Expressive meaning helps communicate emotions and attitudes.
- Grammatical information clarifies whether an utterance is a question or a statement.
- Discourse functions emphasize new information or indicate shifts in topic.

## Examples

- Question intonation in English often includes a rising pitch at the end of the sentence.
- Contrastive stress changes meaning, as in: "I didn't say he stole the *money*," where emphasis alters interpretation.
