# Isolating Languages

Languages in which words are typically composed of a single morpheme, and grammatical relationships are expressed through word order and auxiliary words rather than inflection.

## Characteristics

- Words are often monomorphemic.
- Minimal use of prefixes or suffixes.
- Grammatical functions indicated by word order.

## Examples

- **Mandarin Chinese**:
  - *我* (wǒ) - I
  - *去* (qù) - go
  - *学校* (xuéxiào) - school
  - Sentence: *我去学校* (I go to school)
