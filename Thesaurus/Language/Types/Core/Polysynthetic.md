# Polysynthetic Languages

Languages that use extensive affixation to express complex meanings within single words, often incorporating multiple roots and affixes.

## Characteristics

- Words can consist of many morphemes (high morpheme-to-word ratio).
- Nouns and verbs may combine to form a single word.
- Entire sentences can be expressed as one word.

## Examples

- **Inuktitut**:
  - *tusaatsiarunnanngittualuujunga* - "I can't hear very well"
    - Composed of multiple morphemes expressing the entire sentence.

## Sources
