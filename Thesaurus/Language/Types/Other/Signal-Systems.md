# Signal Systems

Communication systems used by animals, which lack the complexity and generative grammar of human language.

## Characteristics

- Finite number of messages.
- Cannot create new meanings by combining signals.
- Signals often tied to immediate context.

## Examples

- **Bee Waggle Dance**:
  - Bees communicate the location of food sources through specific movements.

- **Bird Songs**:
  - Used for mating calls or territorial signals.

## Key Differences from Human Language

- Human language can produce infinite messages; animal signals cannot.
- Human language can refer to past and future events; animal signals are typically about the present.
