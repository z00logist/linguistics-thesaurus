# Constructed Language (Conlang)

Constructed languages, or "conlangs," are languages that have been intentionally created rather than having naturally evolved. These languages are designed with specific phonological, grammatical, and lexical systems and can serve various purposes, such as linguistic experimentation, artistic expression, or fictional world-building.


## Examples

- **Esperanto** -- constructed langauge, which aim was to make a mediate langauge that every indo-european language speaker would learn fast.
- **Interslavic** -- the same as esperanto, but for speakers of slavic languages.
