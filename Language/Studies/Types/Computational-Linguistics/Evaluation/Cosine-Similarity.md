# Cosine Similarity

Cosine similarity is a measure used to determine the similarity between two non-zero vectors by calculating the cosine of the angle between them. In computational linguistics, it's often used for text similarity by comparing word or document vectors.

## Purpose

- **Text Similarity**: Measures similarity between documents or sentences.
- **Information Retrieval**: Helps rank documents by relevance.
- **Semantic Analysis**: Detects contextual similarity.

## Applications

- **Document Clustering**: Groups similar documents.
- **Recommender Systems**: Recommends content based on similarity.
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identifies similar or duplicate content.
