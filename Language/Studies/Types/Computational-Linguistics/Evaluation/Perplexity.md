# Perplexity

Perplexity is a measurement used to evaluate language models. It indicates how well a probability model predicts a sample. A lower perplexity score suggests that the model has a higher predictive power.

## Calculation

Perplexity is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Perplexity} = 2^{H(p)}
\]

Where:
- \( H(p) \) is the entropy of the probability distribution \( p \).

## Purpose

- **Language Model Evaluation**: Helps assess how well a model predicts text.
- **Performance Comparison**: Used to compare different language models and their effectiveness.
