# Word Error Rate (WER)

Word Error Rate (WER) is a common metric for evaluating the accuracy of speech recognition and translation systems by comparing a reference transcript with a hypothesis.

## Calculation

WER is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{WER} = \frac{\text{Insertions} + \text{Deletions} + \text{Substitutions}}{\text{Total Words in Reference}}
\]

## Purpose

- **Accuracy Measurement**: Assesses how closely the hypothesis matches the reference.
- **System Evaluation**: Used to compare the performance of speech recognition systems.
