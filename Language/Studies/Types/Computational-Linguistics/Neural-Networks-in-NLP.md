# Neural Networks in NLP

Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain's structure, and they have been applied extensively in NLP to model complex patterns in language data.

## Types of Neural Networks

- **Feedforward Neural Networks**: Basic architecture where information flows in one direction.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Designed for sequential data; include memory of previous inputs.
- **Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)**: A type of RNN that can learn long-term dependencies.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Used for capturing local features, effective in text classification.
- **Transformer Networks**: Utilize attention mechanisms to handle dependencies without recurrence.

## Applications

- **Machine Translation**: RNNs and Transformers are used for translating text.
- **Speech Recognition**: Neural networks process audio signals to transcribe speech.
- **Text Generation**: Generating human-like text sequences.
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Identifying entities like names, organizations in text.

## Concepts

- **Embeddings**: Neural networks often use word embeddings as input.
- **Backpropagation**: Training method for updating network weights.
- **Activation Functions**: Functions like ReLU, sigmoid, used to introduce non-linearity.
