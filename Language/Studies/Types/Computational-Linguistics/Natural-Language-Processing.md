# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing is a subfield of artificial intelligence focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

## Key Areas

- **Text Processing**: Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization.
- **Syntactic Analysis**: Parsing sentences to understand grammatical structure.
- **Semantic Analysis**: Understanding meaning and context.
- **Pragmatics**: Understanding language in context, including idioms and metaphors.

## Applications

- **Machine Translation**: Translating text between languages.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the sentiment expressed in text.
- **Text Summarization**: Creating concise summaries of large texts.
- **Question Answering**: Developing systems that can answer questions posed in natural language.

## Techniques

- **Rule-Based Approaches**: Using handcrafted linguistic rules.
- **Statistical Methods**: Leveraging statistical models to make predictions.
- **Machine Learning**: Training models on large datasets to learn patterns.
