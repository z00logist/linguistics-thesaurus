# Wave Theory

The Wave Theory is an alternative model to the tree model in historical linguistics, proposing that linguistic changes spread outward in waves from a central point, affecting languages in a region to varying degrees.

## Key Concepts

- **Isoglosses**: Geographic boundaries of linguistic features.
- **Diffusion**: The spread of linguistic features across languages and dialects.
- **Overlap and Intersecting Changes**: Recognizes that languages may share features due to contact, not just common ancestry.

## Origin

- **Developed by**: Johannes Schmidt in 1872.
- **Reaction to**: Limitations of the Family Tree Model, which doesn't account for language contact and overlapping features.

## Principles

- **Continuum of Change**: Language change is gradual and spreads like ripples.
- **Contact and Influence**: Languages influence each other through proximity and interaction.
- **Non-Discrete Boundaries**: Linguistic features may not align neatly with language boundaries.

## Applications

- **Dialectology**: Explains regional variations and the gradual change across dialects.
- **Language Contact Studies**: Accounts for shared features due to borrowing and convergence.
- **Historical Reconstruction**: Supplements the tree model by considering areal features.

## Advantages

- **Flexibility**: Accommodates overlapping linguistic features.
- **Realism**: Reflects the complexity of language interactions.

## Limitations

- **Complexity**: Less straightforward than the tree model for representing language relationships.
- **Lack of Clear Ancestry Lines**: Doesn't provide a clear-cut genealogical classification.
