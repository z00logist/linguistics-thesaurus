# Mental Spaces Theory

Mental Spaces Theory, developed by Gilles Fauconnier, explains how people construct and manipulate mental representations during thought and language comprehension.

## Key Concepts

- **Mental Spaces**: Small conceptual packets constructed as we think and talk.
- **Mapping**: Connections between elements in different mental spaces.
- **Blending**: Integration of elements from different spaces to create new meaning.

## Applications

- **Metaphor and Metonymy**: Understanding figurative language.
- **Counterfactuals**: Reasoning about hypothetical scenarios.
- **Discourse Analysis**: Analyzing how meaning shifts in conversation.

## Examples

- **Hypothetical Scenarios**: "If I were you, I would go."
- **Role Playing**: "In the game, I'm the knight."
