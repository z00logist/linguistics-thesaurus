# Categorization

Categorization is the cognitive process by which ideas and objects are recognized, differentiated, and understood. It is fundamental to cognition and language.

## Key Concepts

- **Concepts**: Mental representations of categories.
- **Classical Theory**: Categories defined by necessary and sufficient features.
- **Prototype Theory**: Categories centered around typical examples.
- **Exemplar Theory**: Categories represented by specific instances.

## Importance

- **Language Structure**: Influences how words are organized and used.
- **Perception and Memory**: Affects how we perceive and recall information.
- **Reasoning and Decision Making**: Guides how we make inferences.

## Applications

- **Lexical Semantics**: Understanding word meanings and relationships.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Designing algorithms for categorization tasks.
- **Psychology**: Studying how categories are formed and used.
