# Cognitive Semantics

Cognitive semantics is a subfield of cognitive linguistics that studies the relationship between language and the mind, focusing on how linguistic meaning is constructed and understood.

## Key Concepts

- **Conceptualization**: Meaning is constructed through mental representations.
- **Embodied Experience**: Our physical experiences shape our conceptual system.
- **Semantic Networks**: Words are interconnected in a web of meanings.
- **Polysemy**: A single word can have multiple related meanings.

## Theoretical Foundations

- **Image Schemas**: Recurring patterns from sensory and motor experiences that structure thought.
- **Frames**: Structures that represent stereotyped situations.
- **Prototypes**: Central or typical examples of a category.

## Applications

- **Lexical Semantics**: Studying word meanings and relationships.
- **Metaphor Analysis**: Understanding how metaphors shape thought.
- **Discourse Analysis**: Examining how meaning is constructed in context.

## Examples

- **Spatial Prepositions**: Understanding "in," "on," "over" based on spatial relationships.
- **Metaphorical Mappings**: "Time is money" conceptualizing time in terms of economic value.
