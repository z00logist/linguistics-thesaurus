# Conceptual Integration (Blending Theory)

Conceptual Integration, also known as Blending Theory, is a cognitive process where elements and relations from diverse scenarios are combined into a single mental space or "blend," producing new meaning.

## Key Components

- **Mental Spaces**: Partial representations of situations constructed as we think and talk.
- **Input Spaces**: Different mental spaces that contribute elements to the blend.
- **Generic Space**: Contains shared structure between inputs.
- **Blended Space**: The mental space where integration occurs.

## Processes

- **Composition**: Combining elements from input spaces.
- **Completion**: Filling in additional structure based on background knowledge.
- **Elaboration**: Developing the blend through imaginative simulation.

## Applications

- **Metaphor and Analogy**: Explaining how we understand and create metaphors.
- **Humor and Creativity**: Understanding jokes and creative thought.
- **Problem-Solving**: Integrating concepts to generate solutions.
