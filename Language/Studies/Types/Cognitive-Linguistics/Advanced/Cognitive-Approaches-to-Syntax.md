# Cognitive Approaches to Syntax

Cognitive approaches to syntax analyze sentence structure based on meaning and cognitive principles, rejecting purely formal or generative models.

## Key Principles

- **Usage-Based Model**: Syntax emerges from language use.
- **Construction Grammar**: Syntax consists of constructions, or form-meaning pairings.
- **Meaning-Based**: Syntactic structures are inherently meaningful.

## Theories

- **Construction Grammar**: Emphasizes that grammatical constructions carry meaning.
- **Cognitive Grammar**: Views syntax as symbolic and intimately linked to semantics.
- **Role and Reference Grammar**: Focuses on the interplay between syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.

## Applications

- **Language Acquisition**: Understanding how children learn syntactic structures.
- **Language Change**: Analyzing syntactic shifts over time.
- **Typology**: Comparing syntactic patterns across languages.
