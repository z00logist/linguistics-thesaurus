# Cognitive Linguistics and Language Acquisition

This area explores how cognitive linguistics informs our understanding of how language is acquired, emphasizing the role of general cognitive processes.

## Key Concepts

- **Usage-Based Learning**: Language acquisition through exposure and use.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Children detect patterns in language input.
- **Emergent Grammar**: Grammatical structures emerge from language use.

## Theories

- **Constructivist Approach**: Children construct language knowledge from input.
- **Social Interactionist Theory**: Emphasizes the role of social interaction in language learning.
- **Connectionism**: Models language acquisition using neural network simulations.

## Evidence

- **Overgeneralization**: Errors that reflect rule formation (e.g., "goed" instead of "went").
- **Statistical Learning**: Sensitivity to frequency and distribution of linguistic elements.
- **Cognitive Development**: Language development parallels cognitive milestones.
