# Dialectology

Dialectology is the study of regional differences in language, focusing on variations in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary.

## Objectives

- **Mapping Dialect Areas**: Identifying geographic boundaries of dialects.
- **Understanding Language Variation**: Analyzing how and why dialects differ.
- **Preserving Linguistic Diversity**: Documenting endangered dialects.

## Methods

- **Field Surveys**: Collecting data through interviews and questionnaires.
- **Linguistic Atlases**: Creating maps showing linguistic features.

## Examples
- **German Dialects**:
  - **Bavarian**: Characterized by unique vowel sounds and verb conjugations.
  - **Swabian**: Known for distinct intonation and pronunciation differences, especially with consonants.
  - **Low German**: A dialect family with many unique words, preserving older Germanic linguistic features.
  
- **The Survey of English Dialects**: Documented English dialects across England.
