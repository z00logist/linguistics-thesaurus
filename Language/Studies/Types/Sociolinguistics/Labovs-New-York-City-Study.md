# Labov's New York City Study

William Labov's 1966 study on the pronunciation of the post-vocalic /r/ in New York City department stores is a seminal work in sociolinguistics. The study demonstrated the correlation between social class and linguistic variation.

## Background

- **Post-vocalic /r/**: The pronunciation of /r/ after a vowel, as in "car" or "four."
- In New York City, there was variation in the pronunciation of the post-vocalic /r/, with some speakers dropping it (non-rhotic pronunciation) and others pronouncing it (rhotic pronunciation).

## Methodology

- **Data Collection**: Labov conducted a rapid and anonymous survey in three department stores representing different social strata:
  - **Saks Fifth Avenue**: Upper class
  - **Macy's**: Middle class
  - **S. Klein**: Lower class
- **Approach**: Labov asked sales assistants questions designed to elicit the phrases "fourth floor," which contain two opportunities for the post-vocalic /r/.

## Findings

- **Correlation with Social Class**: Pronunciation of /r/ increased with the prestige of the store.
  - **Saks Fifth Avenue** employees pronounced /r/ most frequently.
  - **Macy's** employees showed the greatest shift when asked to repeat, indicating linguistic insecurity.
  - **S. Klein** employees pronounced /r/ least frequently.
- **Style Shifting**: When asked to repeat, many employees increased their use of /r/, demonstrating awareness of the prestige associated with rhotic pronunciation.

## Significance

- **Social Stratification**: The study provided empirical evidence of social stratification in language use.
- **Linguistic Insecurity**: Highlighted how speakers adjust their speech in response to perceived social norms.
- **Methodological Innovation**: Introduced the rapid and anonymous survey technique in sociolinguistics.

## Impact

- **Foundation for Variationist Sociolinguistics**: Labov's work laid the groundwork for studying language variation in relation to social factors.
- **Influence on Subsequent Research**: Inspired numerous studies on language and social class, gender, and ethnicity.
