# Sentence Processing

Sentence processing involves the cognitive mechanisms by which humans comprehend and produce sentences, parsing syntactic structures and interpreting meanings in real-time.

## Parsing Strategies

- **Incremental Parsing**: Processing sentences word by word as they are heard or read.
- **Garden Path Sentences**: Sentences that lead the parser to an incorrect interpretation initially (e.g., "The old man the boats").
- **Parsing Models**:
  - **Serial Models**: One syntactic interpretation is considered at a time.
  - **Parallel Models**: Multiple interpretations are processed simultaneously.
  - **Constraint-Based Models**: Use multiple sources of information (syntax, semantics, context).

## Factors Affecting Processing

- **Ambiguity**: Structural or lexical ambiguities can slow processing.
- **Context**: Prior context can facilitate parsing.
- **Working Memory**: Limited capacity can affect the ability to process complex sentences.

## Applications

- **Reading Comprehension**: Developing strategies to improve understanding.
- **Language Disorders**: Assisting individuals with aphasia or specific language impairment.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Improving natural language understanding systems.
