# Language Disorders

Language disorders, or language impairments, are conditions that affect an individual's ability to acquire, produce, or comprehend language. Psycholinguistics studies these disorders to understand language processing and develop interventions.

## Types of Language Disorders

### Aphasia

- **Definition**: Loss or impairment of language abilities due to brain damage.
- **Types**:
  - **Broca's Aphasia**: Difficulty in speech production; comprehension relatively intact.
  - **Wernicke's Aphasia**: Fluent speech with nonsensical content; impaired comprehension.
  - **Global Aphasia**: Severe impairment in both production and comprehension.

### Specific Language Impairment (SLI)

- **Definition**: Delayed or disordered language development without an obvious cause.
- **Characteristics**: Difficulties with grammar, vocabulary, and discourse.

### Dyslexia

- **Definition**: Learning disorder affecting reading and spelling.
- **Symptoms**: Difficulty with phonological processing, decoding words.

### Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

- **Language Issues**: Challenges with pragmatics, non-literal language, and social communication.

## Assessment and Intervention

- **Standardized Tests**: Evaluating language abilities.
- **Speech Therapy**: Individualized treatment plans.
- **Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)**: Supporting communication through non-verbal means.

## Applications

- **Neurorehabilitation**: Restoring language functions post-injury.
- **Educational Support**: Accommodations in learning environments.
- **Research**: Understanding the neural basis of language.
