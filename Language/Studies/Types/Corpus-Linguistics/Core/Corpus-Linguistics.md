# Corpus Linguistics

Corpus linguistics is an empirical approach to studying language that involves the systematic analysis of large collections of naturally occurring texts (corpora).

> **McEnery and Hardie (2012):**
> "Corpus linguistics provides empirical data for investigating linguistic phenomena, revealing patterns not evident from intuition alone."

## Key Concepts

- **Corpora**: Large, structured sets of texts used for linguistic analysis.
- **Concordance**: A list of all the occurrences of a word or phrase in a corpus, along with its context.
- **Collocation**: The habitual juxtaposition of a particular word with other words.
- **Frequency Analysis**: Examining how often words or structures occur.
- **Annotation**: Adding linguistic information to a corpus (e.g., part-of-speech tags).

## Applications

- **Language Description**: Understanding language usage and variation.
- **Lexicography**: Developing dictionaries based on actual usage.
- **Language Teaching**: Creating teaching materials informed by authentic language data.
- **Computational Linguistics**: Training language models and natural language processing systems.
