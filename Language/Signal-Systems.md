# Signal Systems

Communication systems used by animals, which lack the complexity and generative grammar of human language.

## Characteristics

- **Limited Set of Signals**: Finite number of messages.
- **Non-Generative**: Cannot create new meanings by combining signals.
- **Context-Dependent**: Signals often tied to immediate context.

## Examples

- **Bee Waggle Dance**:
  - Bees communicate the location of food sources through specific movements.
- **Bird Songs**:
  - Used for mating calls or territorial signals.

## Key Differences from Human Language

- **Productivity**: Human language can produce infinite messages; animal signals cannot.
- **Displacement**: Human language can refer to past and future events; animal signals are typically about the present.
