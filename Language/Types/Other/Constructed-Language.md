# Constructed Language (Conlang)

Constructed languages, or "conlangs," are languages that have been intentionally created rather than having naturally evolved. These languages are designed with specific phonological, grammatical, and lexical systems and can serve various purposes, such as linguistic experimentation, artistic expression, or fictional world-building.


## Types of Constructed Languages

1. **Artistic Languages (Artlangs)** -- Created for aesthetic or fictional purposes, often with a focus on cultural and historical context.
2. **Auxiliary Languages (Auxlangs)** -- Designed to facilitate international communication, typically with simplified grammar (e.g., Esperanto, Ido).
3. **Logical Languages (Loglangs)** -- Constructed with logical precision to eliminate ambiguity and explore new thought processes (e.g., Lojban).
4. **Engineered Languages (Englangs)** -- Created for experimental or analytical purposes, often used to test linguistic hypotheses.

## Examples

- **Esperanto**: A well-known auxiliary language intended for universal communication, known for its regular grammar and ease of learning.
- **Elvish Languages (Quenya and Sindarin)**: Languages created by J.R.R. Tolkien for the *Middle-earth* universe, characterized by a deep, historically rich structure.
- **Klingon**: A constructed language developed for the *Star Trek* universe, known for its unique phonology and warrior culture emphasis.
- **Lojban**: A logical language developed to reduce ambiguity and based on predicate logic.
