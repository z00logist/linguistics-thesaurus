# Sign Languages

Natural languages that use the visual-manual modality to convey meaning, possessing their own grammar and lexicon.

## Characteristics

- **Visual-Manual Modality**: Uses hand shapes, movements, facial expressions.
- **Complex Grammar**: Fully developed linguistic systems.
- **Not Universal**: Different regions have different sign languages.

## Examples

- **American Sign Language (ASL)**:
  - Used in the United States and parts of Canada.
- **British Sign Language (BSL)**:
  - Used in the United Kingdom.

## Misconceptions

- **Not Derived from Spoken Language**: Sign languages are independent and not simply signed versions of spoken languages.
- **Equally Complex**: As sophisticated as spoken languages in terms of grammar and expression.
