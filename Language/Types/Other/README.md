# Other Types of Languages

These language types are categorized separately because they are distinct from spoken and written linguistic structures. While categories like Agglutinative, Analytic, and Synthetic refer to morphological and grammatical structures in spoken languages, Sign Languages and Signal Systems operate through non-verbal, often visual, or gestural means. This unique mode of communication and transmission sets them apart from traditional spoken language classifications.
