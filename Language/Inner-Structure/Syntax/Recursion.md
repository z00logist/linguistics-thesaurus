# Recursion

Recursion is the property of language that allows for the embedding of structures within similar structures, enabling the creation of infinitely long sentences.

## Examples

- **Nested Clauses**:
  - "The cat that chased the mouse that stole the cheese that came from the farm that..."
- **Coordination**:
  - "He likes apples and oranges and bananas and..."

## Importance

- **Generative Capacity**: Demonstrates the infinite potential of language.
- **Syntax Structures**: Essential in forming complex sentences.
