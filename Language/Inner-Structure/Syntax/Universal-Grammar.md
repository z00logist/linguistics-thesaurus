# Universal Grammar

Universal Grammar is the theory that the ability to acquire grammar is hard-wired into the brain, and that all human languages share certain fundamental principles.

> **Chomsky (1986):**
> "Universal grammar provides the underlying structure common to all languages."

## Key Concepts

- **Innateness Hypothesis**: Humans are born with an innate language faculty.
- **Language Acquisition Device (LAD)**: Hypothetical brain mechanism for language learning.
- **Principles and Parameters**: Universal principles with language-specific parameters.

## Importance

- **Language Acquisition**: Explains how children learn complex grammar quickly.
- **Cross-Linguistic Studies**: Helps identify universal linguistic features.
