# Dependency Grammar

Dependency grammar is a type of syntax theory that focuses on the relationships between words, where structure is determined by dependencies rather than phrase structure.

## Characteristics

- **Head-Dependent Relations**: Every word (dependent) is connected to a head.
- **No Phrase Nodes**: Unlike constituency grammar, no phrasal categories.
- **Tree Structure**: Forms a connected tree with one root (the main verb).

## Importance

- **Emphasis on Relationships**: Highlights the direct connections between words.
- **Computational Applications**: Useful in parsing algorithms.
