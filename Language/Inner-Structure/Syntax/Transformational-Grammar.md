# Transformational Grammar

Transformational grammar is a theory proposed by Noam Chomsky, suggesting that deep structures of sentences can be transformed into surface structures through grammatical transformations.

## Key Concepts

- **Deep Structure**: The underlying syntactic structure of a sentence.
- **Surface Structure**: The final syntactic form after transformations.
- **Transformations**: Rules that convert deep structures into surface structures.

## Examples

- **Passive Transformation**:
  - Active: "The cat chased the mouse."
  - Passive: "The mouse was chased by the cat."

## Importance

- **Universal Grammar**: Provides insight into innate language structures.
- **Syntax Analysis**: Explains complex syntactic phenomena.
