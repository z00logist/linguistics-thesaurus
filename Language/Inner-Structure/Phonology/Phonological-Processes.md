# Phonological Processes

Phonological processes are systematic sound changes that occur within a language's phonological system.

## Types of Phonological Processes

- **Assimilation**: A sound becomes similar to a neighboring sound.
- **Dissimilation**: A sound becomes less like a neighboring sound.
- **Insertion (Epenthesis)**: Addition of a sound.
- **Deletion (Elision)**: Omission of a sound.
- **Metathesis**: Reordering of sounds.
- **Palatalization**: Consonants become closer to palatal sounds.

## Examples

- **Assimilation**:
  - "Input" pronounced as [ɪmpʊt]
- **Deletion**:
  - Silent 'k' in "knight"
- **Metathesis**:
  - Old English "brid" became "bird"

## Importance

- **Language Evolution**: Shows how languages change over time.
- **Speech Patterns**: Helps in understanding dialectal variations.
