# Phonology

Phonology is the study of how sounds function within a particular language, focusing on the system and patterns of sounds that convey meaning.

> **Hayes (2009):**
> "Phonology examines the abstract, grammatical characterization of systems of sounds or signs."

## Key Concepts

- **Phoneme**: The smallest unit of sound that can distinguish meaning.
- **Allophone**: Variations of a phoneme that do not change meaning.
- **Phonotactics**: Rules governing permissible sound combinations.
- **Phonological Processes**: Patterns of sound change (e.g., assimilation, palatalization).
