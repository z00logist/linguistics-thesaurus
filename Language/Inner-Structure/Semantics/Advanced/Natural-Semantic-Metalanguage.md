# Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM)

The Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) is a linguistic theory developed by Anna Wierzbicka and colleagues, proposing that all meanings can be decomposed into a set of universal semantic primitives.

## Key Concepts

- **Semantic Primes**: A set of basic, universal meanings found in all languages (e.g., "I", "you", "someone", "something", "good", "bad").
- **Reductive Paraphrase**: Explaining complex meanings using only semantic primes.
- **Culture and Language**: Emphasizes the relationship between language, thought, and culture.

## Semantic Primes

- **Substantives**: I, you, someone, something, people.
- **Determiners**: This, the same, other.
- **Quantifiers**: One, two, some, all, many.
- **Evaluators**: Good, bad.
- **Descriptors**: Big, small.
- **Mental Predicates**: Think, know, want, feel, see, hear.
- **Speech**: Say, words, true.

*(The list continues to cover approximately 65 primes.)*

## Applications

- **Cross-Linguistic Semantics**: Comparing meanings across different languages without bias.
- **Intercultural Communication**: Facilitating understanding by using universal concepts.
- **Language Teaching**: Assisting learners in grasping core meanings.

## Importance

- **Avoiding Circular Definitions**: Uses irreducible concepts to define words.
- **Cultural Scripts**: Describes cultural norms and practices using semantic primes.
- **Translation Studies**: Aids in achieving semantic equivalence across languages.
