# Formal Semantics

Formal semantics is the study of linguistic meaning using formal tools from logic and mathematics. It aims to model how language users understand and interpret sentences.

## Key Concepts

- **Model-Theoretic Semantics**: Uses models to represent possible worlds and truth conditions.
- **Truth-Conditional Semantics**: Assigns truth values to sentences based on their meaning and context.
- **Lambda Calculus**: A formal system for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application.
- **Type Theory**: Categorizes expressions into types for proper semantic composition.

## Approaches

- **Montague Grammar**: Developed by Richard Montague, integrates formal logic with natural language semantics.
- **Possible Worlds Semantics**: Considers different possible states of affairs to analyze meaning.

## Applications

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Improving computational models for AI.
- **Philosophy of Language**: Analyzing philosophical questions about meaning and reference.
- **Syntax-Semantics Interface**: Understanding how syntactic structures map to semantic interpretations.
