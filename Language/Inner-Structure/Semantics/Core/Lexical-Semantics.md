# Lexical Semantics

Lexical semantics is the study of how and what the words of a language denote. It focuses on the meanings of words and the relationships among them.

## Key Concepts

- **Word Meaning**: Understanding the inherent meaning of words.
- **Semantic Relations**:
  - **Synonymy**: Words with similar meanings (e.g., "big" and "large").
  - **Antonymy**: Words with opposite meanings (e.g., "hot" and "cold").
  - **Hyponymy**: Hierarchical relationship where one word is a kind of another (e.g., "rose" is a hyponym of "flower").
  - **Meronymy**: Part-whole relationships (e.g., "wheel" is a part of "car").
- **Polysemy**: A single word having multiple related meanings (e.g., "bank" as financial institution and riverbank).
- **Homonymy**: Words that are spelled or pronounced the same but have different meanings (e.g., "bat" as an animal and "bat" used in sports).

## Approaches

- **Componential Analysis**: Breaking down word meanings into smaller semantic features.
- **Prototype Theory**: Categories have central (prototypical) members and less central members.
- **Cognitive Semantics**: Meaning is a function of cognitive processes and experiences.

## Applications

- **Dictionary Compilation**: Defining words and their meanings.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Word sense disambiguation in computational models.
- **Language Teaching**: Vocabulary development and understanding nuances.
