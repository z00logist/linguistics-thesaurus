# Coarticulation

Coarticulation is the phenomenon where speech sounds overlap and influence each other during speech production.

## Types of Coarticulation

- **Anticipatory (Forward) Coarticulation**: A speech sound is influenced by a following sound.
- **Perseverative (Backward) Coarticulation**: A speech sound is influenced by a preceding sound.

## Examples

- **"Key" vs. "Cool"**:
  - The /k/ sound is produced more forward in the mouth in "key" due to the front vowel /i/, and further back in "cool" due to the back vowel /u/.

## Importance

- **Natural Speech**: Coarticulation contributes to the fluidity of speech.
- **Speech Recognition and Synthesis**: Understanding coarticulation is crucial for accurate models.
