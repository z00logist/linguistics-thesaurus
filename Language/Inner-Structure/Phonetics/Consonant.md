# Consonant

A consonant is a speech sound produced with some constriction or closure in the vocal tract, impeding the airflow.

## Classification

Consonants are classified based on:

- **Place of Articulation**: Where the constriction occurs.
- **Manner of Articulation**: How the airflow is constricted.
- **Voicing**: Whether the vocal cords vibrate.

## Examples in English

- **Bilabial Stops**: /p/ (voiceless), /b/ (voiced)
- **Alveolar Fricatives**: /s/ (voiceless), /z/ (voiced)
- **Velar Nasal**: /Å‹/ as in "sing"
