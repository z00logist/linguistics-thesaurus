# Phonetics

Phonetics is the study of the physical properties of speech sounds, including their production (articulatory phonetics), acoustic properties (acoustic phonetics), and perception (auditory phonetics).

> "Phonetics is the science concerned with the physical properties of speech sounds."

## Branches of Phonetics

- **Articulatory Phonetics**: How speech sounds are produced by the movement of speech organs.
- **Acoustic Phonetics**: The physical properties of speech sounds as sound waves.
- **Auditory Phonetics**: How speech sounds are perceived by the listener.

## Key Concepts

- **Articulation**: The movement of speech organs to produce sounds.
- **Vowels and Consonants**: Classification of speech sounds based on their production.
- **International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)**: A standardized system for transcribing speech sounds.
