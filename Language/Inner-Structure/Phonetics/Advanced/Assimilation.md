# Assimilation

Assimilation is a phonetic process where a sound changes to become more like a neighboring sound.

## Types of Assimilation

- **Regressive (Anticipatory)**: A sound is influenced by a following sound.
- **Progressive (Perseverative)**: A sound is influenced by a preceding sound.
- **Contact (Adjacent)**: Sounds directly next to each other influence each other.
- **Distant (Non-adjacent)**: Sounds not directly adjacent influence each other (less common).

## Examples

- **English**:
  - "Input" pronounced as [ɪmpʊt], where /n/ becomes [m] before /p/.
  - "Handbag" often pronounced as [ˈhæmbæɡ].

## Importance

- **Speech Efficiency**: Assimilation simplifies articulation.
- **Phonological Rules**: Helps in understanding patterns in language.
