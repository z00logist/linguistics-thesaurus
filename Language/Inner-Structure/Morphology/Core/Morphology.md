# Morphology

Morphology is the branch of linguistics concerned with the form and internal structure of words. It examines how morphemes—the smallest units of meaning—combine to create words.

> **Katamba (1993):**
> "Morphology deals with the rules governing word formation."

## Key Concepts

- **Morpheme**: The smallest grammatical unit that carries meaning.
- **Word Formation**: Processes like derivation and compounding that create new words.
- **Inflection vs. Derivation**: Inflection modifies a word's tense, number, aspect, etc., without changing its core meaning or class, while derivation changes the meaning or part of speech.
