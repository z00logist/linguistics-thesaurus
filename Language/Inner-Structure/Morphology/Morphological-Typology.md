# Morphological Typology

Morphological typology is the classification of languages based on their morphological structure, particularly how they use morphemes to form words.

## Types of Morphological Languages

- **Isolating Languages**: Few or no affixes; words are typically single morphemes.
  - Example: Mandarin Chinese
- **Agglutinative Languages**: Words formed by stringing together morphemes, each representing a single grammatical meaning.
  - Example: Turkish
- **Fusional (Inflectional) Languages**: Morphemes may convey multiple grammatical meanings simultaneously.
  - Example: Russian
- **Polysynthetic Languages**: High morpheme-to-word ratio; words can contain many morphemes, often combining nouns and verbs.
  - Example: Inuktitut

## Importance

- Helps linguists understand and compare the structural diversity of languages.
- Reveals patterns and commonalities across different language families.
