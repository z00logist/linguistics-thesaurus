# Suppletion

Suppletion is a morphological phenomenon where an irregular morphological change occurs, and a morpheme is replaced entirely by a different morpheme.

## Characteristics

- **Non-Predictable Forms**: Cannot be derived from the root.
- **Irregularity**: Breaks normal morphological patterns.

## Examples

- **English**:
  - "Go" → "Went" (past tense)
  - "Good" → "Better" → "Best" (comparative and superlative)
- **Spanish**:
  - "Ir" (to go) → "Fui" (I went)

## Significance

- Challenges theories of morphology that rely on regular patterns.
- Important for understanding language evolution and historical linguistics.
